The child was discovered dead later. During an interview with Reelz's '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Casey Anthony: Her Friends Speak</a>', set to air on December 9, Clint House speaks about the woman's behavior from the time her two-year-old girl went missing.</p><p>On one of the days, in particular, the friend highlighted the mother's attitude shortly after she was acquitted where she had said, "I sleep pretty good at night". He claimed that this wasn't the response a mother would normally give if she had just lost her child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7089da71-1635-46be-8de8-db8d49618d6b.png><p>In the episode that begins at 8 pm ET/PT, House said: "She's lying about everything," as he cries at the spot where the toddler's body was dumped. He added: "And that interview, where she says she sleeps pretty good at night, are you kidding me?"&nbsp;</p><p>House continued: "If I was put on trial for killing my kid, and I was acquitted because I didn't do it, as soon as I walked out of those doors at the courthouse, I would be on a manhunt trying to find out who killed my kid. I wouldn't sleep again until I found out who killed my kid. That says everything you need to know."</p><p>He was mentioning a comment that Anthony made in an interview with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> in 2017. Anthony said: "I don't give a s**t about what anyone thinks about me, I never will. I'm OK with myself, I sleep pretty good at night."</p><p>House was convinced, however, that she had a part to play in Caylee's death because of her actions before the child was reported missing. The two-year-old disappeared on June 16 that year and her grandmother only told authorities that she has disappeared on July 15, one month later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/d399434d-34cf-4bc8-9013-a97559c1357c.png><p>The man, who had been staying with Anthony Lazzaro, Anthony's then-boyfriend, Cameron Campana, and Nathan Lesniewicz, said that he saw her participate in a "hot body contest" at a Fusion nightclub event that he hosted. This was at the same time that she should have been concerned about her child's whereabouts.</p><p>He explained: "At that time, none of us knew that Caylee was missing." He added that they weren't even shocked by her actions at the time because she never told anyone that her child was missing.&nbsp;</p><p>House said: "We couldn't be surprised. We weren't surprised until after the fact, until police were talking about it, asking questions. Until the media got ahold of it and things exploded. We were shocked and surprised that she could be out here doing what she had been doing that night, and meanwhile, her child is missing. It came as a big shock once we found out about it. But we just didn't know."</p><p>Even before Anthony went on her infamous trial, she didn't seem flustered when she saw House in downtown Orlando. He said: "She just didn't seem like there was anything wrong. She was like, 'Hey, how's it going? Good to see you'. Then we went our separate ways. That's the hardest part about this whole story, is that she was just completely so normal during the time Caylee was supposedly missing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/201e3ed8-2ce9-4770-95b0-e5a1ec547f7c.png><p>Anthony had initially claimed that her daughter went missing with a babysitter and her lawyer argued later that the child drowned accidentally. House said in the interview that he hasn't heard from the mother since then but other people, pretending to be her, have tried to contact him on Facebook.</p><p>He also said that he met Caylee a few times because Anthony had stayed over at his house so regularly and called the child "intelligent". He said: "She was probably one of the sweetest little girls. Very articulate for her age. You could understand 90 percent of the words that were coming out of her mouth when she was talking to you. She seemed just so full of life, and she was just a great little girl. She was very well-behaved."</p><p>Even today, House still maintains that the Anthony that the group of friends knew was "a very loving and attentive mother" who never once got angry with her child. He said on the program: "I even testified to that in the trial. That is what I saw with my own two eyes. I never saw her grab Caylee in any kind of abusive manner. I never saw her have to discipline Caylee because Caylee was such a well-behaved child… She just seemed like a good mom."</p><p></p><p>Even though 10 years have gone by since the toddler's remains were found in a spot on the side of the road, House said that the sad story "still affects us to this day". As he went to the site for the first time, House — who is a father himself — shed tears thinking of the child's death.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about the day he heard that Caylee had vanished, House said: "There's nothing you can do to prepare yourself to hear something like that. It was like a punch in the gut."</p><p>He continued: "How was it that all the searchers miss this?… It was harrowing to be there and see the leftover remains of all the people that had come and put stuffed animals that had started to decompose into the dirt. That was just really hard, knowing that's where she ended up. She didn't deserve that at all. She really didn't."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5Gosrp5wKeroaeernqzscSlsWahnqmys8LInq5mnqKesq%2Bw0marqJyUobKzecKasKWdlWKur8DHqKWyZZ2ewLS1zaBkq52dlravv4yrppqcXZeyqa3VoqarZZOhtq%2FAjKGmrquV</p></div><div id=links><a href=./denise-richards-and-daughter-leaked-onlyfans-videos-photos.html>&#171;&nbsp;Denise Richards and Daughter Leaked Onlyfans Videos &amp;amp; Photos The Talks Today</a>
