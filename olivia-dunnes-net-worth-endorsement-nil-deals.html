As Parade noted, she tends to represent brands in the fashion space. When interviewed on the podcast Full Send, she explained that she was given over $500,000 for one post on Instagram. While it doesn't seem like that happens all the time, that is definitely an impressive number.</p><p>Olivia Dunne grew her net worth after <strong>getting her first NIL deal in 2021 </strong>and these partnerships are why she has a $3.5 million net worth. According to The Sun, Dunne has been earning money from NIL deals since her first one, which was with Vuroi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/olivia-dunne-put-her-net-worth-in-jeopardy-by-making-a-massive-mistake-on-instagram-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Vuroi reportedly paid the star six figures, she continued to get many different brand deals. Her autograph and photo were even on a Leaf Trading Card. While the amount that she earned from that is unknown, it must have been lucrative given her social media following.
