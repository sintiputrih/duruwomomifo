of making it to the big leagues.&nbsp;However, it was not so easy.&nbsp;For years, Fisher only handled small roles in movies that didn’t get too much attention.&nbsp;But that all changed in 2007, when Noel was cast in&nbsp;</span><span>The Rich</span><span>, the FX series about Irish crooks where Noel portrayed Cael Malloy.</span></p><p>The series only lasted two seasons, but it was enough to give Fisher’s career the boost it long deserved.&nbsp;Since then he has gone on to achieve better things and the future only looks brighter.</p><h2><strong><span>Age, early childhood and rise to fame</span></strong></h2><p><span>Noel Roeim Fisher was born in his native Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia on March 13, 1984. Fisher credits his parents for the talented artist he has become.&nbsp;The actor has repeatedly said that his parents encouraged him to take different types of lessons, including piano, his favorite.&nbsp;He also took acting lessons and, at the age of 14, got his first role in&nbsp;</span><span>The Sheldon Kennedy Story</span><span>, a sports drama film about hockey player Sheldon Kennedy.</span></p><p><span>Noel Fisher hasn’t looked back since then, although fame for him was not instantaneous.&nbsp;Throughout her teenage years, Fisher starred in both small and big-screen roles, but neither was big enough to be called her breakthrough until the mid-2000s. Fisher’s first hit came.&nbsp;</span><span>Godiva</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Rich</span><span>.&nbsp;He celebrated his first successes by sponsoring a baby girl in Zambia, an experience he described as one of the most rewarding of his life.</span></p><p>Fisher has had roles in notable shows like&nbsp;<span>Bones, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Criminal Minds: Suspicious Behavior</span><span>, and many more.&nbsp;He got a major break after being cast as gay thug Mickey Milkovich in&nbsp;</span><span>Shameless</span><span>.&nbsp;Fisher missed the final callback for his character on Shameless.&nbsp;However, he was so desperate for the role that he recorded an impersonation director session which he sent to the casting directors.&nbsp;Fortunately, they liked it and called it to read the part.&nbsp;The rest is history.</span></p><p><span>In movies, Noel Fisher had roles in&nbsp;</span><span>War Los Angeles</span><span>&nbsp;(2011), and&nbsp;</span><span>The Twilight Saga: Breaking the Dawn – Part 2</span><span>&nbsp;(2012), where he played the 1,500-year-old vampire Vladimir.&nbsp;He voiced the character Michelangelo in two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated films.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Noel Fisher gay, has a wife or girlfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>When an actor plays a particular character, well, audiences are bound to wonder if he’s drawing on real personal experiences.&nbsp;Such is the case with Noel Fisher, who plays an incredible role as gay character Mickey Milkovich on Showtime’s Shameless.</span></p><p>The thing is, Noel Fisher is really just a great actor and doesn’t draw on any personal experience to portray this gay part.&nbsp;In fact, Fisher is not only straight, but differs from his character in Shameless, a faithful lover.&nbsp;Since 2005, even before he found success in the industry, Fisher has been in a relationship with famous Afghan actress Layla Alizada to whom he is now married.</p><p><span>The pair reunited in the make-up trailer for Canadian comedy-drama Godiva’s.&nbsp;However, they didn’t show much interest until the party ended.&nbsp;That night they got closer and had their first kiss.&nbsp;After about a decade of dating, Fisher popped the question to her Afghan stepfather during a romantic trip to St. Regis in Bora Bora in May 2014.</span></p><p><span>The couple waited another year before sealing the deal in an intimate wedding ceremony held on July 15, 2017, which was attended by only 60 close relatives and friends.&nbsp;In their interview with PEOPLE, the couple described their day as a magical day.&nbsp;The bride was dressed in a dress by Morilee while Fisher opted for a sky blue tuxedo by Kenneth Cole.</span></p><p><span>Layla Alizada was born on August 10, 1977. She has appeared on many notable TV shows among them&nbsp;</span><span>The Muppets, Days of Our Lives, Eyes Closed</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Jane the Virgin</span><span>.&nbsp;The couple starred together in the 2015 Oscar-nominated short&nbsp;</span><span>Day One</span><span>.&nbsp;They have long been settled in Los Angeles.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>Noel Fisher is of average height, being 170cm (5ft 7in) tall.&nbsp;Fisher is a few inches shorter than his wife Layla Alizada, who is about 6 feet tall.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiho2K7sLHLZp2iq5iav26zwLJknaeVqHqpsYyhmK%2BdXZZ6uLXFnmShoaNirqixjKGcop%2BYqXqiusNmn6KrXZy2s7jFq6CeppRk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-microsoft-surface-pro-4-review-raising-the-bar.html>&#171;&nbsp;New Accessories: Type Cover, Surface Pen, Surface Dock</a>
