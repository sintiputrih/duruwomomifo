According to Celebrity Net Worth, the rapper is worth $12 million. However, his net worth is questionable, with some publications reporting that he is worth $15 million. The rapper will investigate the excess culture and the prices people are willing to pay for things that seem better or unique in the current season of VICE’s reality series, motivated by a hook point: Is it worthwhile? Is this s**t? Or should it be “The S**t”?</p><p>According to VICE, the official description for Most Expensivest Season 4 is:</p><p>“2 Chainz reveals all of the lavish ways the 1% loves blowing its load.”</p><p>Most Expensivest Season 4 will air on VICE on Monday, February 13, at 10 p.m. ET.</p><h2>Meet acclaimed rapper 2 Chainz, one of VICE’s Most Expensivest Rappers.</h2><p>Tauheed Epps, best known as 2 Chainz, was born on September 12, 1977, in College Park, Georgia. Despite growing up in a low-income neighborhood, Chainz excelled in school, finishing second in his class. He also played basketball as a kid and got very good at it.&nbsp;Despite his sports ambitions, 2 Chainz, 45, maintained a wild side and sold cocaine and marijuana to his peers. When he was 15, he was arrested for felony cocaine possession. The rapper began his musical career in high school when he teamed with a handful of his friends to compose his first raps.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-Chainz-2.jpg alt="2 Chainz" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Known as T**y Boi since 1997, the American rapper adopted the moniker “2 Chainz” only in 2011. He started his music career in 1997 when he formed Playaz Circle, a hip-hop duo with his boyhood buddy Earl Conyers.&nbsp;Conyers, better known as Dolla Boy, helped 2 Chainz release his first independent album, United We Stand, United We Fall, in 2002. The rapper’s record caught the attention of Atlanta rapper Ludacris, who pushed the duo’s tracks for radio airplay and helped them gain recognition.</p><p>Supply & Demand, the duo’s debut studio album, was released in 2007. Lil’ Wayne featured on the album’s debut single, Duffle Bag Boy, which quickly became successful. Chainz performed the song at the BET Hip-Hop Awards. After releasing one more studio album, 2 Chainz left Playaz Circle and Ludacris’ Disturbing Tha Peace to concentrate on his solo career.</p><h2>The emergence of 2 Chainz as a solo act</h2><p>2 Chainz transitioned to solo artistry shortly after leaving his first album, which gave him his break when he changed his moniker to the present one in 2011. The rapper considered the moniker to be more “family-friendly.”</p><p>T.R.U. REALigion, a mixtape, was released as his first solo album the same year. He collaborated with well-known pop musicians like as Kanye West and Nicki Minaj under his new alias and established a solo career. 2 Chainz’s debut studio album as a solo artist was completed in 2012. The first single from the album, No Lie, featuring Drake, was initially titled “Based on a T.R.U. Story.” The album sold 147,000 sales in one week and debuted at the top of the Billboard Top 200, further propelling his solo career.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-Chainz.jpg alt="2 Chainz" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Dolla Boy worked with the rapper again on his second studio album, B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time, which was released in 2013. ColleGrove, a collaborative album by the artist and Lil’ Wayne, was released in 2016. Later in the year, he released two additional mixtapes. The fourth studio album, Pretty Girls Like Trap Music, was released in 2017. His second studio album, Rap Or Go To The League, was released in 2019.</p><h2>2 Chainz’s Personal Life</h2><p>2 Chainz married In 2018, and he was dating Kesha Ward. One of their three children is their eldest kid, born in 2008.&nbsp;He began his clothes business by selling hoodies under the brand CEO Millionaires and sweaters under the brand Dabbing Sweaters. He has brand endorsement deals with firms like as Adidas and Beats By Dr. Dre, to mention a few. The rapper also has a tiny stake in the College Park Skyhawks.</p><p>In September 2011, the hip-hop musician paid $517,000 for a foreclosed 22-acre property in Palmetto, Georgia. He then built an incredible complex hideaway on the site.&nbsp;In 2016, the rapper spent $2.5 million for a home in Los Angeles’ Beachwood Canyon neighborhood. The property was originally owned by guitarist Steve Vai, who converted it into a large, well-equipped recording studio. Slash, Eddie Van Halen, and Ozzy Osbourne have all recorded at the mansion. In addition, in March 2022, the star paid $3.8 million for a home in the Hollywood Hills. In addition, 2 Chainz gave $1 million to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>The reality star is also the creator of his own music label, The Real University. He has his own charity organization, TRU foundation, through which he has undertaken several charitable endeavors. In 2017, the rapper became involved with VICE’s reality show, Most Expensivest, which has broadcast over 40 episodes to date.</p><h2>Season 4 of Most Expensivestest</h2><p>As a presenter, hip-hop star, and Grammy winner 2 Chainz takes viewers on an intriguing and surprising journey through the “culture of excess.” Motivated by a fundamental question, the rapper analyzes a broad variety of products and services. Most Expensivest Season 4 will determine if $5,000 Chicken Wings, a $800 bottle of beer, or $4,000 dog cologne are worth it in New York City and Las Vegas. The program delves headlong into the 1%’s incredibly rich society.</p><p>High Notes, episode 1 of Most Expensivestst Season 4, states:</p><p>With special guests Joe Banamassa, Hit-Boy, and Angelo Moore, we search for pricey musical collections, meet luminaries, and learn about the instruments that shaped their careers.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhpZpuYlravxoyiqmarlal6tbuMmqepnZGneqK%2FjJpkoaejqXqwuoysnJqrn6N6dXnOn2Smp6OpeqbEz56lrKGmmsC1ew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./9622041207-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bring a Torch, Jeanette, Isabella</a>
