Their recent Instagram activity has also sparked speculations of their split.

They were seen together having lunch date with Liam’s parents. A source revealed that the couple left the same house together and arrived at the spot to meet the family.</p><p>The source added, “They were at lunch no longer than an hour. Everyone was chatty and shook hands on arrival. Liam’s mum looked very happy to see him, gave him a big cuddle. It seemed like a happy, family environment.” The insider also admitted that the couple “did not show off any PDA,” but they went back together to Liam’s house after the lunch date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miley Cryus Blames Her Divorce From Liam Hemsworth On One Thing</a></span></p><p>As seen in the picture, the model seemed to fit perfectly with the Hemsworth family. As photos of the duo continue to swirl on social media, many are wondering how the two really met. It remains, however, unclear how they met, but it is thought that Liam crossed paths with Gabriella after he moved back to his homeland Australia after his divorce.</p><h2 id=are-liam-hemsworth-and-gabriella-brooks-still-together>Are Liam Hemsworth And Gabriella Brooks Still Together?</h2><p>After the first public appearance of the couple in 2019, photos of them <a href=#>sharing kisses at the beach</a> in Byron Bay, New South Wales surfaced on social media in January 2020. One thing that fans were quick to notice in the pic is that Liam is in great shape, signaling that he has truly moved on from the heartbreak of his past marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many thought that the model was just a rebound following the actor’s split with Miley, a source of an outlet revealed that the two are “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very happy together and it’s comfortable and easy</a>.” It is also noted that Liam’s family “approves of her and really likes her” and that his family’s approval “is very important to Liam.”</p><p>Proving that the Hemsworth family warmly welcomes Gabriella in their lives, Liam’s brother, Chris Hemsworth, posted a photo on Instagram. The picture shows the Hemsworth brothers with their significant others as they celebrate the oldest son Luke’s 40th birthday party. Gabriella seemed to be quite at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liam seems to prefer to keep their relationship private and intimate, unlike his very publicized married life with Miley. A source told Us magazine that the actor and his girlfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">continued to grow close together</a>. “He feels more at home with Gabriella than he did with Miley and feels like he can be his complete self without any drama,” the source said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Interesting Facts About Liam Hemsworth’s Childhood</a></span></p><p>“Gabriella helped Liam boost his confidence and played an encouraging role in his life after his split with Miley…,” the source added. In 2020, an insider of the magazine also assured fans that the two are going strong together.</p><p>“They’re both secure in their relationship and Gabriella isn’t worried that Liam has any lingering feelings for Miley and isn’t intimated by their relationship. Liam and Gabriella are really close and feel comfortable with one another. They connect over important topics and share the same values about family and life,” the insider said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-liam-hemsworth-and-gabriella-brooks-getting-engaged>Are Liam Hemsworth And Gabriella Brooks Getting Engaged?</h2><p>When it comes to tying the knots again, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam seems to be ready to take another step</a>. “Liam and Gabrielle have been getting serious. They’re not ones to make it known to the public, but their friends and family sure are in the know about how close they are and how an engagement can be right around the corner,” a source told Us in May 2021.</p><p>The source added, “Liam looks up to his brothers and would love to one day also have that long-lasting marriage with a partner. He’s ready to be a husband – he just wants to be super confident in his relationship with Gabriella before he gets down on one knee.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the couple has yet to announce their engagement, fans have to wait until then. Let’s hope to see more photos of the duo in Instagram (as the two prefer not to share any). While some may find this rather weird, it is safe to say that they are trying to keep their relationship low-key. Social media certainly doesn’t define how much they care about each other.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>20 Things To Know About Liam Hemsworth’s Model Flame, Gabriella Brooks</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dobaiuYyhnKarp6S%2FtbSMoJibqpmaua2tjJupqKebqHq0wMilo2asn5yytbTEq2Y%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./drew-barrymore-yellow-swimsuit-photo.html>&#171;&nbsp;Drew Barrymore Rocks Yellow Swimsuit: Photo Hollywood Life</a>
