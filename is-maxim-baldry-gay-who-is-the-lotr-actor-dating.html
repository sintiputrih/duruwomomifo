Yawn,” a user twitted.</span></p><p><span>While another shared, “Huge amount of sour grapes on my part. Why do the two gay characters have to be so gorgeous and sexy? Fantastic program and great acting.&nbsp; Quite scary. Is that the way we are really going?”</span></p><p><span>However, there were also a few who appreciated the show normalizing the LGBTQ+ community. “I’ve never seen a gay couple like you on the screen who are so real and everyone in the episode treats you as an ordinary couple,” a fan remarked.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Maxim Baldry Dating?</b></h3><p><span>Maxim Baldry is likely single as of 2022.
