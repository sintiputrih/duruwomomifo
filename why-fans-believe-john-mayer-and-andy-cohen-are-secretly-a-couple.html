The 46-year-old <strong><a href=#>musician</a></strong> was also <a href=#>linked to Kiernan Shipka who's half his age</a>. But his longest public relationship so far was with <strong><a href=#>Katy Perry</a></strong>. They were together, on and off, from 2012 to 2015.</p><p>At one point, there were rumors that they'd gotten engaged. In 2013, they released a duet hit, Who You Love. "I've been such a fan, I think he's so incredibly talented and gifted and a genius songwriter," Katy told E! News of their collab (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via Who</a>). "So to be a part of anything he was doing was just natural."</p><p>They dedicated several more songs to each other, including some breakup ballads. The two reportedly split due to conflicting work schedules. Perry had just embarked on her Prismatic World Tour, and insiders said she knew it would have been hard to juggle that and her romantic life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, Mayer said that he hadn't moved on from Perry yet. "Who else would I be thinking about?" he told the New York Times about his then-new song, Still Feel Like Your Man. "And by the way, it's a testament to the fact that I have not dated a lot of people in the last five, six years. That was my only relationship. So it's like, give me this, people."</p><p>At that time, the Dark Horse songstress had already been seeing <a href=#>her fiancé, Orlando Bloom</a>. Meanwhile, Mayer had just given up on the celebrity dating app, Raya. "It's just lot of chatter," he said of his experience back then. "We all talk to the same people. There are very few people actually meeting up."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/how-john-mayer-s-dad-unintentionally-inspired-his-life-and-music-career.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How John Mayer’s Dad Unintentionally Inspired His Life And Music Career</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>John Mayer's father played an important role in his life and influenced his career in ways many may not have realized.</span><h2 id=are-andy-cohen-and-john-mayer-dating>Are Andy Cohen And John Mayer Dating?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar51136024.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cohen is known to have <a href=#>close friendships with celebrities like Sarah Jessica Parker</a>. It's even their tradition to go to the Met Gala together instead of the <a href=#>Sex and the City star</a> going with <a href=#>her husband, Matthew Broderick</a>. So it's no surprise that Cohen is also that suspiciously close with Mayer.</p><p>During a recent interview with <strong><a href=#>Howard Stern</a></strong>, the Bravo star addressed the speculations and swore on his children's lives that he'd never fooled around with Mayer. "I am in love with John Mayer. We are in love with each other," he jokingly explained. Stern then said: "Swear on your children's lives there's never been anything sexual between you and John Mayer," to which Cohen replied, "I swear."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, the Your Body Is a Wonderland hitmaker is straight. Still, imaginative netizens like the idea that the two look like a couple moving in together in some paparazzi photos. In <a href=#>this Instagram clip</a>, someone claimed that they look like they're "buying their dream home together," alongside photos of Cohen's grandmother steaming Mayer's shirt and the pair showing off their matching watches.</p><p>Despite many people supporting the wild theory, a commenter argued: "Hate to break this to you…straight men and gay men can be close friends. I'll give you a moment to get the smelling salts and flop properly onto the fainting couch in shock. But let's pretend they were an item… Good. For. Them. They don’t have to tell a soul.

However, fans have always wondered if he and fellow TV personality, Anderson Cooper have ever dated. In the early 1990s, the two were set up on a blind date. But Cooper immediately called it off when they spoke on the phone to set up the meeting.</p><p>"We had a phone call to set up the date, and I knew within 45 seconds I was never going on a date with Andy Cohen," he shared on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon. "He violated my cardinal rule, which is he asked me about my mom [Gloria Vanderbilt] within the first minute of talking to me."</p><p>Cohen then admitted: "I wanted to date the Vanderbilt boy! I was excited!" About a decade later, the two started hanging out with the same circle of friends — vacationing together and eventually developing a solid friendship. In 2015, they kicked off their AC2 tour in Boston. Two years later, they began co-hosting CNN's New Year's coverage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, their sons met each other for the first time during a virtual episode of WWHL. Two years later, they had that <a href=#>boozy New Year's coverage that almost got Cohen fired</a>. They remain big supporters of each other despite finding out that they'd hooked up with the same man in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ybnKWhlauybrbOoaVmpZGusrN5wKebZpmemcZur86hnKdlkaeybr%2FEnKmerJyueqJ5wqisqaSVZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./201-west-16th-street.html>&#171;&nbsp;201 West 16th Street, Apt. 4F, Sales Price, Co-op, Chelsea, NYC</a>
