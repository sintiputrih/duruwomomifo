And there was a man standing there with a script in his hand and he said he was a director of movies," Caine said in an interview with Variety Magazine last year.</p><p>That would become the beginning of a very fruitful partnership <a href=#>and friendship</a> between the two men, one that Caine came to thoroughly enjoy.</p><p>"Playing the movie was absolutely fantastic," he reminisced, before going to explain what he thought made Nolan special: "The thing about Nolan is you don’t always know what’s going on in the scene, as an actor. And you ask him, and he says, 'I’ll tell you after you’ve done it.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Christopher Nolan's 10 Best Movies, Ranked According To IMDb</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Caine would go on to reprise the role in The Dark Knight (2008), and eventually in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).

I’m thinking I’m letting friends in, instead of which he’s killed them all, and he’s coming up in the lift.</p><p>"So on the first rehearsal, when the bloody door opened on that lift, he came tearing out," Caine continued.
