She has made several public calls for information and has spoken to the media numerous times.</p><p>Neal has also been instrumental in the passage of Monkey’s Law, the new missing person alert system established in honor of Michael.</p><p>This law could prove critical&nbsp;in locating missing children and preventing other families from going through the same trauma as the Vaughans.</p><p>The search for Michael continues, and authorities are looking into the matter.
