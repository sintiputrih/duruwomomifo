Talking about him, Rosamund said once that he is “the most interesting person I’ve ever come across”. She also said that he is very “articulate and ruthless” about the roles she takes on.

It said that he had been disqualified as a company director. It was after he admitted to several offenses during the investigation into the collapse of his company Pale Fire Ltd.</p><p>Furthermore, he also admitted to not paying HMRC since July 2012, although he received £260,508 in his account during the next couple of years. Moreover, he used £144,060 of that money for his personal use, £10,514 on mobile phones, and £25,154 on other payments and bank charges.
