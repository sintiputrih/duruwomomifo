While her birth date and month are not confirmed, it is believed that she will be 37 years old on her birthday in 2024.</p><p>Morgan’s education was completed entirely in Canada, where she attended high school and college. She has successfully obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from her university.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Morgan Macgregor has critiqued works of fiction for BookBrowse, Book Riot, and The Paris Review. Additionally, she used to hold a position as an editor at the Los Angeles Review of Books. According to her bio on BookBrowse, she had previously shown interest in opening a bookstore.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Morgan-MacGregor.webp alt="Morgan MacGregor" width=600 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>According to Macgregor, her preference lies in contemporary American literature. She expresses her admiration for writer Jonathan Franzen, having become a fan after reading his compilation of essays in 2002 entitled How to Be Alone.</p><p>In September 2012, Book Riot featured a review of the book by Macgregor.</p><p>“I’m obsessed with it. I watch him on Charlie Rose … and it’s solidified: I love Jonathan Franzen.”</p><p>Donna Tartt’s 1992 book, The Secret History, is one of her preferred reads. It centers on six tight-knit students at a made-up liberal arts school called Hampden College, located in Vermont. In her biography on BookBrowse, Macgregor expressed her admiration for the novel stating,</p><p>“Donna Tartt probably owes her about $1,000 in royalties by now, due to her ceaseless recommending of&nbsp;The Secret History&nbsp;to pretty much everyone she meets.”</p><p>While speaking to The Guardian in 2014, Hall expressed his admiration for Macgregor’s love of books.</p><p>“I suppose […] I probably benefit more from her expertise than she does from mine. She has a unique ability to place books with people, myself included, so that’s a nice perk.”</p><p>Despite lacking the experience of her husband, Morgan Macgregor has had prior television appearances during her childhood in Canada. In a 2012 piece for The Paris Review, she shared about her teenage fascination with boy bands Hanson and The Moffatts, which led to her being featured in a Canadian documentary series.</p><p>She wrote about the experience in her biography,</p><p>“I had a posse, and we were famous in the world of band fans. We were interviewed in newspapers and by radio and television stations everywhere we went. The Life Network did a special on us called The Things We Do for Love.”</p><p>She further added,</p><p>“When we showed up at the&nbsp;Sally Jesse Raphaelshow&nbsp;in New York to see The Moffatts, the fans waiting outside the studio screamed for us, asked us for our autographs. We were famous for loving famous people.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2012, Morgan Macgregor and Hall made their relationship public by appearing together at the <a href=# rel=noopener>Emmys</a>. While attending, she showed her support for Hall’s nomination for outstanding lead actor for his role on <a href=# rel=noopener>Dexter</a>. Unfortunately, he was not chosen as the winner, losing to Damian Lewis from Homeland.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Morgan-Macgregor-husband.webp alt="Morgan Macgregor husband" width=400 height=414 data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In February 2016, Macgregor and Hall quietly tied the knot at City Hall in New York City after being together for almost four years since their public debut in 2012.</p><p>Speaking about his third marriage to <a href=# rel=noopener>Morgan MacGregor</a>, Hall shared,</p><p>“It’s the charm. She’s just an incredible friend and is a remarkable combination of intelligence and kindness, and she’s able to tell me the truth in a way that I can stomach.”</p><p>Although Michael Hall and Morgan Macgregor have discussed the topic, they do not have any children together. In a 2018 interview with The Daily Beast, Hall mentioned that having children is a topic they frequently discuss and consider.</p><p>“It’s no news to anyone, but it’s a crazy world, and bringing somebody into that world for a front-row seat is something that gives me pause.”</p><p>Even though they have reservations about having kids, Hall and Macgregor have a dog together, a dark-colored dachshund named Salamander.</p><p>Despite achieving fame on television and in theater, Hall and his partner choose to live a private life away from public attention. They are seldom seen in photographs together and Hall avoids talking about his relationship in the media.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Morgan MacGregor, with a <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> exceeding $2 million, indulges in a lavish lifestyle as a well-known figure.
