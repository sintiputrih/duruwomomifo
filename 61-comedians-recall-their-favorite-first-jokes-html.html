comedians — comedians have to start somewhere, and that’s with the first jokes, show, or stand-up special they saw that left an impression on them. So, Vulture polled more than five dozen comedians and comedy writers, big and small, to find out what some of their favorite jokes of all time are, what jokes changed their lives, or what jokes pushed them to get into comedy in the first place — in some cases all of the above.

It’s a gas pump handle. Then he says, “See this? I got this for $5. Yep. Pretty good deal …” and then he just trails off and transitions into something else. It’s so absurd, so funny, and so socially satirical. He is my all-time. The Marx Brothers, too.

But everything from the ‘70s and ‘80s was horribly racist, which is probably why it was funny, but it also wasn’t funny, at all. There was zero political correctness and there were zero censors. I feel like the only joke that comes to mind is the one about the bear and the rabbit shitting in the woods. Well, there is a bear and a rabbit and they’re shitting in the woods, and the bear says to the rabbit, “Do you have a problem with shit sticking to your fur?” And the rabbit says, “No, I don’t.” And so the bear picks up the rabbit and he wipes himself.

I don’t remember exactly how the joke went, but the punch line was, “Not the soap dear, radio!” But the thing was, it had nothing to do with the beginning of the joke, which was a long set up about a male lion talking to his lioness wife after coming home from work. I didn’t get it at all, and my dad kept saying, “Get it?” Then, after a tortuous hour or so where I felt borderline retarded, he explained that it didn’t make sense … on purpose. It was like a trick, an anti-joke! And that blew me away. Completely changed how I could see things. It was my earliest exposure to Dadaism, a term which I wouldn’t come across for almost 20 years. I was also a huge&nbsp;Lou Costello fan when I was tiny. [One of my favorite jokes of all time] is from Chuck Sklar: “I went home to Chicago to visit my mom the other day, she made my favorite meal, ‘pancakes — all you can eat, ten dollars.’”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-85fbf1140490362a9d8224b9cf8d4ee8-18-0-0@published data-word-count=132><strong>Natasha Leggero (<a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=RS3Uap>Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber</a>)</strong><br>I remember this Christian girl coming to school with this anti-abortion pamphlet, which was a diary in the voice of an unborn fetus, and it ended with “May 25th, today my mother killed me” — and I thought it was so hysterical I couldn’t stop laughing. I just thought it was so funny. The girl was horrified. That’s when I knew something might be wrong with me. I had never really seen any comedians when I decided to try [comedy] — I was always more into music.

When I saw that, I realized you can do anything in comedy so long as it’s funny and not too harsh. In college, I got to see Bill Burr, Donnell Rawlings, Charlie Murphy, and Patrice O’Neal. The crowd was apathetic, but it didn’t seem like they had a care in the world. I thought they were the coolest dudes on the planet.

So I wished for a million dollars and that’s how I got rich. Then I asked for a beautiful woman, and that’s how I met my wife.” The friend says, “Wow! What was the third wish?” The guy says, “Well that’s where I think I went wrong.

European.” Even as a kindergartner, that joke made me rethink how I was looking at geopolitics. It’s weird and awkward to say in light of recent news, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say that as a kid, Bill Cosby was one of the first comedians that I saw, which meant a lot as a brown kid, to see a brown person be funny on their own terms. I was not aware and cannot condone anything else he was doing on his own terms, but purely as the comedian I saw on television, he was an early influence for me. My grandmother and I would watch Lucille Ball, Redd Foxx, and Andy Griffith on TV and I thought they were all hilarious. Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, and Richard Pryor were all people that I discovered as I got a little older. My stepfather tried to explain Mudbone to me and after that, anytime we were at a public restroom he would say, “The water’s cold,” and I’d say, “And it’s deep, too.” In Living Color and SNL were huge influences in my teens. ​</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-85fbf1140490362a9d8224b9cf8d4ee8-25-0-0@published data-word-count=56><strong>Ron Funches (<a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=EA7Un8>Undateable</a>)</strong><br>Seeing Tig Notaro just push around a stool onstage for what seemed like ten minutes changed my perspective of what I can do onstage.

I saw The&nbsp;Blues Brothers&nbsp;when I was like eight years old, before I’d really seen&nbsp;SNL, and that blew my mind too, the idea that a whole movie could be based on two guys who barely talked and just acted like dicks and got away with it. My favorite part was when Belushi is messing with the uptight family in the fancy restaurant where Mr. Fabulous works and he’s like “How much for the women? Sell me your children! How much for the leetle girl?!” That really resonated for me and I’d constantly imitate it. When I was 10 they started playing the show&nbsp;The Young Ones&nbsp;(which is the best) on MTV and that got me into British comedy — Monty Python, the show The Comic Strip Presents… and everything I could find with Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson. Then I was really into&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;with Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Mike Myers, etc., then&nbsp;The Simpsons&nbsp;was the only thing I cared about for a while.

His good battles with his own evil. It’s amazing. He perfectly defined the existential crisis I didn’t even know anyone else felt. He showed how we’re all naturals, but complete amateurs at the same time. Something everyone thinks about every damn day. And then he makes a reference to <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>?! I was like, <i>Holy shit I thought </i>I<i> was the only black kid that knew about that!</i> As a kid, I watched him on the original <i>SNL</i>s. And I loved some of his ‘80s movies like <i>The Toy</i> and <i>Brewster’s Millions</i>, but when I finally saw his stand-up, I couldn’t comprehend it. It’s what every comedian that was around him said, and every comedian after him: this man can’t be touched. I thought if I try to be half as good as that, that would be enough to be considered one of the greats. I grew up watching those original <i>SNL</i>s, but it wasn’t until I saw Robert Townsend and His&nbsp;<i>Partners in Crime</i> that I saw myself doing it. This is one of the most slept-on comedy programs of all time. Stand-up mixed in with sketches put together by Robert. It was a precursor to <i>In Living Color</i>. It was a bridge from an older generation to the guys that were about to take it from there. You saw Paul Mooney, Tommy Davidson, Franklin Ajaye, Robin Harris, John Witherspoon, David Alan Grier, and all the Wayanses.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-85fbf1140490362a9d8224b9cf8d4ee8-29-0-0@published data-word-count=103>Woody Allen also has a joke where he’s talking about getting cast as God in a college play which he says was “typecasting.” Since it was method acting he starts “living the part,” wore a blue suit, taking taxicabs, tipping big because, “<i>He</i> would have.” The final punch always gets me … when he gets into a fight with a guy who hit his fender, “and I said unto him … I said ‘be FRUITFUL and MULTIPLY’ … but not in those words.” Then there’s this huge laugh of people getting it at different times while Woody silently giggles to himself.

I loved wrestling as a kid, and watched it for that experience, but was crying laughing the first time I saw it. I couldn’t believe someone that weird and funny could cause that much trouble, and I wasn’t sure exactly on what level I was supposed to enjoy it. That lit a fire under me that I think still fuels a lot of what I try to do. I think Louis C.K.’s “<a href=#>Guy in Traffic</a>” is a perfect joke.

The first was an Andy Kaufman NBC special about his life. I never knew that much about him before that. And the second was “The Cross/Odenkirk Problem,” a live show with Bob [Odenkirk] and David [Cross] they did in LA to try to sell a TV show.

Eventually, he leaves with one of the women.&nbsp; The next day, the same thing happens.&nbsp; The next day, the homeless man inquires about the man’s secret. “Every woman who passes by, I say, ‘Tickle your ass with a feather?’ If they’re offended, I just tell them I said ‘Particularly nice weather.’ &nbsp;Eventually someone wants their ass tickled, and I leave with them.”&nbsp;The homeless man knows he has to try this. So the next day, he sits on the park bench. But he’s so nervous, he starts to partake of some liquid courage. He gets more and more drunk, trying to work up the nerve to talk to a woman.&nbsp; Eventually, he’s blitzed, and a woman passes by. “Stick a feather up your ass?” he asks.&nbsp;She turns around. “What’d you say to me?”&nbsp;“It’s fucking raining out!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-85fbf1140490362a9d8224b9cf8d4ee8-33-0-0@published data-word-count=97><b>Jen Kirkman</b> <strong>(<a href=#>Chelsea Lately</a>)</strong><br>When I was about ten, I saw a Gallagher special and he said, “What’s the opposite of pro-gress?

I kept waiting for her to tell me to turn it off, but she didn’t. She wanted to watch it too. She kept asking me if it was okay for me to be watching this, and I would say, “Yeah … it’s fine!” The best was the joke about wanting a McDonald’s hamburger and having your mother insist on making you her version which was all fucked up, with big chunks of peppers hanging out of it. My father used to do the exact same thing, and it made me feel very close to Eddie. I went to a lot of shows at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre before I started taking classes there. One of the best shows ever, to this day, was Ali Farahnakian’s one-man show Word of Mouth. It was a loose collection of characters and stories, but it just worked as a whole, and every individual piece was hilarious. In one bit, he would put on a creepy devil mask and give life advice and tips to the audience. He shared how, if you dipped your penis in honey and put it in front of an infant, the baby would automatically start sucking your dick. When the crowd groaned, he would indignantly cry, “What?! It’s a natural sucking mechanism! What did you expect? I’m the devil!” Now that I have children the joke is doubly funny because you’re really not supposed to give honey to infants. There’s a high risk of botulism. I don’t know if I have a favorite joke, but one of the scenes that has always stuck with me and made me laugh is in <i>A Fish Called Wanda</i>. Kevin Kline is sent to apologize to John Cleese. He’s a complete, macho asshole, and loathes the idea of apologizing to this pathetic Englishman. He sits in his car beating the steering wheel and fuming, trying to force himself to utter a practice apology. He then sneaks into the house, mistakes John Cleese for a burglar, and beats him with a fireplace shovel. Upon realizing what he’s done, he becomes immediately and genuinely apologetic, saying, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry …” over and over in a high-pitched voice, while John Cleese moans in agony. That immediate and acute reversal of character was always so funny to me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-85fbf1140490362a9d8224b9cf8d4ee8-35-0-0@published data-word-count=69><strong>Lea DeLaria (<a href=#>Orange Is the New Black</a>)</strong><br>The Carol Burnett Show changed my life and taught me that it’s good to be able to do everything.

Seinfeld was the one comedian where I was like — what?! Stand-up can sound like that?! A joke can be worded like that?! He has one line in a longer section about airplane travel (I know, I know), where he’s describing the way flight attendants look back at coach passengers as they close the curtain to first class. And the way he describes it is something like, “They look at you like ‘You know, if you’d just worked a little harder, I wouldn’t have to do this.’” It blew my mind because it was so casual, and it got the biggest laugh. It showed me that stand-up can come in a million different forms, not just setup-punchline, you just have to be authentic and do it your way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-85fbf1140490362a9d8224b9cf8d4ee8-37-0-0@published data-word-count=155><strong>Cristela Alonzo (<a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=RQIX9R>Cristela</a>)<br></strong>I used to work as the office manager at the Addison Improv before I started doing stand-up.

There was a bass player that would come to Dallas from Houston when Mitch was in town to play bass in the background. There was this one night … it was a Thursday, the club was packed, and it had this really cool supper club vibe to it. It reminded me of old stand-up albums I’d hear as a kid where you could hear people eating as the comic performed. There was something so special about that night. Mitch was killing with no effort and that bass in the background … it just heightened the vibe. I remember thinking, “This is what stand-up is.

Stanhope’s because it really sums up what I think is cool in stand-up — a combination of really funny, kind of horrible, with a sense of justice. And Stewart’s bit because it’s like a technical class on stand-up. Also, when I first saw Eugene Mirman perform in maybe 2000, it was the first time I saw someone talking about things that I’d want to talk about onstage. It was the first time I saw a stand-up that I thought was cool, and not old fashioned.

Here’s a guy who tosses a lot of razor-sharp punchlines into what is ultimately a dumb, funny story. Okay, let me start by saying, I formed this opinion many, many years ago. Without getting into personalities or endorsing anyone as a human being, Bill Cosby’s To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With is one of the greatest pieces of stand-up comedy of all time. Everything you need to know about putting together a bit is here; from act-outs to callbacks to timing.

A musical number on&nbsp;The State&nbsp;called “Porcupine Racetrack” made me want to write funny songs. My favorite joke of all time is an Anthony Jeselnik’s joke: “When I finished high school I wanted to take all my graduation money and buy myself a motorcycle. But my mom said no.

It was the first time I saw live sketch comedy, and it took away all the thoughts that doing sketch comedy had to be huge and produced. It could just be two guys onstage saying where they are, what they’re doing. It was amazing. Then, of course, to follow it up with Norm, who is one of my all time favorite stand-ups. When I moved to Los Angeles I knew I wanted to get into comedy but wasn’t sure in which capacity I would be able to.

And one day in elementary school I picked up this giant book called like 1,001 Jokes, Goofs, and Yuk Em’ Ups or whatever, and I just read that cover to cover, a million times, repeating all of it out loud. What a mistake they’d made. I eventually broke the binding and carried it in two pieces. They were the worst jokes, to: nonsense knock-knock jokes and puns and Q&A’s. But my favorite were the worst kind in the book, these story-jokes that always involved an Irishman, a Scotsman, and a German doing something together. I have no idea what about those appealed to me so much: they were so long, with so much repetition, they required many minutes of the listener’s time, there was no natural way to segue into telling them, and they relied on knowing stereotypes about those nationalities I did not and still don’t get, plus you had to remember so many beats to retell them. Actually, that sounds like a lot of my act now. I get it. That was when I first become obsessed with telling jokes. I remember exactly the moment I thought to myself, “Oh, wait, this is doable.” I was at a pre-frosh weekend at a college, at the college I ended up going to, and on the first night I saw the campus stand-up comedy club perform. It was a weird set-up, where they were all onstage at once and handed the mic back and forth, and did one joke at a time, but they were very good. (Two of the guys, Matt Goldich and Jordan Carlos, are wonderful people I now know, and who are professional writers and comedians.) But I realized, watching that night, that they were just regular guys who liked jokes, and got how [jokes] worked and were willing to get up onstage&nbsp;and try them, and I realized I could also do that. They weren’t grizzled dudes making jokes about divorce in front of a brick wall, which was most of my exposure to TV stand-up comedy at that point, and something that felt very distant as a career path. The next day, I skipped all the classes I was supposed to go to and instead just read the campus humor magazine in a dark snack bar, alone, and said to myself, this is the funniest thing I’ve ever read, and, like, I could work on this.<strong> </strong></span>The comedian Greg Johnson has the best joke of all time, which is about him reading the Frequently Asked Questions pamphlet at his local library. I literally can’t do it justice, but he just repeats the question, “Security in the basement?” over and over, and I have thought about this joke every day for the last nine years. I don’t even think it’s online, because Greg plays by his own rules, but anyone who has seen comedy in the NY in the last decade has probably seen this bit, and become obsessed with it. No comic’s cadence or jokes have rewired my brain or earwormed themselves into my skull more than Greg Johnson’s. He’s an American treasure.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-85fbf1140490362a9d8224b9cf8d4ee8-47-0-0@published data-word-count=101><strong>Greg Johnson <b><span>(</span><span>Myrtle Comedy</span><span>)</span></b></strong><br>I was eight and used to watch Comic Strip Live on Saturday nights and one of the comics said, “I don’t like to go camping because I don’t like pretending that I don’t have a home!” The funniness and truthfulness busted my brain.

I called them “Switcharoos.” Jokes that set up a punchline one way, and then did a total one-eighty. Like when Marge thought she was hearing Homer as a voice-over, but he was actually in the backseat whispering to her. Or when Wiggum is getting a phone number and it’s a 555 number, and he says “Ah, must be a fake,” and throws it into a fire. The&nbsp;Simpsons were actually pretty funny!

Hope you like crap.” Later on I was driving with my friend Steve, talking about that joke, and laughing so hard that I almost crashed the car. It’s not even a great joke.

My dad was conveniently at work. I’d said something lascivious to my cousin who was visiting and my mom decided — it was time. This was too important to wait for my father to get home. She sat me down and said to me, “Okay Bobby, this is how it happens. The man puts his penis into the woman’s vagina.” I stared at her blankly and innocently asked, “But how does he get it through the pajamas?” Of course, that got around the family and eventually, as I got older, somehow found its way onto a talk show. Besides being obsessed with Groucho Marx, Johnny Carson, and Dean Martin on television — when I was 14 I lived in Los Angeles for a little while, so I would sneak underage into the best sitcoms that existed, including&nbsp;All in the Family, Mary Tyler Moore, Sanford and Son,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Carol Burnett Show. When I was 17 I moved to Philadelphia and I underage-snuck into the Latin Casino in New Jersey to see the great Don Rickles. I would say the culmination of watching the brilliance of those legendary sitcoms combined with seeing the effortless hilariousness of Don Rickles live, was altogether astonishing to me, yet I still didn’t think I’d end up in comedy. There definitely can’t be just one [favorite joke]. This one comes to mind off the top of my head … An elephant is in the jungle under a coconut tree and a tiny mouse climbs up on his back and says to the elephant, “I am going to give you the best sex of your life. You okay with that?” The elephant agrees, and so the little mouse starts going at it. After a couple minutes, a coconut falls from the tree and hits the elephant hard on the head. “OW!!!” he yells. To this the mouse replies, “Suffer bitch.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-85fbf1140490362a9d8224b9cf8d4ee8-59-0-0@published data-word-count=100><strong>Dane Cook</strong> <b><span>(</span><a href=#>Troublemaker</a><span>)</span></b><br>I remember watching a ton of stand-up growing up but I loved&nbsp;SNL.

I have a favorite joke that’s short enough: A guy walks into a pet store, and he says, ‘I’d like to buy a bird.’ And the pet store owner says, ‘Certainly sir.

The image of that monkey fucking his head was drilled into my psyche. He was talking about a monkey fucking his ear, and my parents were laughing at it. I couldn’t believe they were responding so positively to such dirty language. I wanted to do that. Also, Woody Allen’s moose bit. In a nutshell, a guy hits a moose on the road and straps it to the fender. He takes it to a costume party. It comes in second in the costume contest because it loses to the Berkowitzes, a married couple dressed as a moose. The moose and couple fight and knock each other out. Woody grabs the unconscious moose and drives it back to the woods,&nbsp;but, he got the Berkowitzes … It goes on from there. It’s genius writing with right turn after right turn and none of it is predictable.

This is the first comedy bit I can remember quoting incessantly. I have a specific memory of being at my grandparents’ house and acting this bit out for my very Catholic and very mortified grandmother as my parents sat speechless, too stunned to intervene and stop me from reciting everything I could remember. I guess I was 12 or so at the time. This habit of absorbing&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;stuff or&nbsp;Monty Python&nbsp;stuff and then acting it all out for my friends, and quoting it over and over started with Velvet Jones. I don’t think any one comedy bit made me want to get into comedy, but this was the start of my appreciation-slash-obsession with it. The thing that made me want to get into comedy was probably just an unquenchable desire for the positive affirmation that I wasn’t getting from family or school.
