met on the set of the 2005 Pride & Prejudice adaptation — which Wright directed and Pike starred in. She was 25 years old and he was 31.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a>, Pike and Wright "began seeing each other tentatively during the shoot," but things didn't get serious until the film wrapped.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Interestingly, Pike also worked on the film with her ex-boyfriend, actor Simon Woods.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I tried very hard not to cast Simon, but I knew he was perfect," Wright told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> in 2005. "Finally I rang Ros and asked if she'd mind, and she said, 'Absolutely not.' They hadn't seen each other for two years but the next day they were dancing together. It was lovely."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Franco Origlia/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The director reportedly proposed in 2007, just two days ahead of the Venice Film Festival premiere of his film Atonement. Wright told The Observer that he'd had to turn down a dinner invitation from George Clooney in order to pull off the big ask.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was a bit surprised – I couldn't tell him why, but I was just about to propose and was getting a bit nervous," Wright said of Clooney.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-we-loved-them></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why We Loved Them</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wright — for all his later, uh, wrongs — was quite effusive when it came to his relationship with Pike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I just properly love her," Wright told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> in early 2008. "She's so intelligent and uncompromising. She impresses me so much in every way and we have a laugh. I feel I can do anything with her, go anywhere, do anything, if we want to. The pipe dreams happen with her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued to praise his bride-to-be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I spent so many years trying to be cool, to be someone I wasn't really, but now after four years with her, I find I'm accepting that fat kid who wore cravats to school and who couldn't read. I had a dream the night I got engaged, in Italy, that I had a heart transplant, and it really feels like I'm a new person, a person I like much more."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wright surprised Pike with a "thank you" credit on Atonement. "Without her, the film wouldn't be half what it is," Wright said in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview</a>. "There's a lot of stuff about being in love in the film, and she helped me understand that."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-they-peaked></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When They Peaked</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Coordinating white-on-white is a choice — one that requires bravery, confidence, and an arsenal of Tide to Go pens.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jon Furniss/WireImage</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By June 2008, less than a year after Wright had proposed, British tabloids gleefully spread the word: the wedding was off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Daily Mail perpetuated a rumor that Wright had called off the wedding after Pike sent out invitations that featured an image of the couple in a hot tub. Furthermore, the outlet reported that days following the split, Wright was "spotted cavorting with a handful of girls at his local lap-dancing club."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Pike often avoided discussing the breakup in interviews, the following year she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> via email that she had "no idea why Joe called off the wedding."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was never clear about it," she went on, "Part of what makes it so confusing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She clarified the tabloid spins, writing, "Our Save the Date cards had been sent out; Save the Date cards which had a 1950s-style picture of the two of us in LA, taken by a friend at Christmas, done like an old-fashioned postcard with slightly unreal colors — we'd both designed it and the design was to make people laugh! Which it did! — but no invitations. My mother had to write to everyone to say that the wedding was no longer going to take place."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Vince Bucci/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the bit about Wright's post-breakup activities, Pike called BS. "I also think that the stories about Joe being seen in lap-dancing clubs are false," she said. "It really doesn't sound like him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pike refused to publicly condemn Wright, calling him an "extraordinary man.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the bruises remained. "I don't think you ever get over something like that," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress spoke of the media coverage of her and Wright's split again in 2010, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Sunday Times</a> that the wedding planning had not been as far along as the tabloids made it sound.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I mean, all this stuff about organising flowers and cakes! It's like, no way!" she said. "The truth is that I hadn't even tried on a fucking wedding dress! When you're an actress you've so many chances to do the fairytale thing. For me it wasn't about the wedding at all, it was about the marriage. I was really interested in marriage, and what it means, and what one promises. I take that very seriously. To say those things, and to commit to somebody in that way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that "losing that trust was massive. Massive."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Philip Cheung/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2011, Pike alluded to the ordeal in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle UK</a>. "When you're about to get married, and then you're not, it's all a big shock," she said. "You think, well, OK, so I'm never going to lead a totally conventional life now. It sort of cleans the slate and now I can be exactly who I am. Everyone gives you leeway too, because they can see that you've had something pretty painful go on."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2014, Pike spoke broadly of her relationships with her exes, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Sunday Times</a>, "I'm still proud to have been in a relationship with them. They're all people I admire."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even if you get hurt by someone … Sure, it takes a few years. I may not have said that at the time but they're people I'm happy to have shared time with."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wright, despite his many words of praise for Pike during their relationship, declined to comment on its demise. When asked to address the split during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Sunday Times</a> in 2012, the director simply told the reporter "No."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-they-are-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where They Are Now</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pike has been with mathematician Robie Uniacke since 2009. The couple share two sons: Solo, who was born in 2012 and Atom, who was born in 2014. After the 2014 hit movie Gone Girl with Ben Affleck, Pike starred in the Netflix thriller I Care a Lot in 2020. Up next for the actress is the thriller Saltburn with Jacob Elordi and Rich Flu.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wright wed musician Anoushka Shankar in 2010. The pair welcomed sons Zubin in 2011 and Mohan in 2015 before splitting in 2018. The director has since been linked to actress Haley Bennett, with whom he welcomed a daughter in late 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Obq2aqn6iursHNnWSpoZuaequ7xGauq6GXncFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXP</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-tommy-lees-net-worth-biographynet-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is Tommy Lees Net Worth: Biography,Net Worth &amp;amp; more</a>
