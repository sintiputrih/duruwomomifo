And, let's face it, the industry is filled with them. Everyone from <a href=#>Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio</a> to the older generation, such as <a href=#>Godfather Part 2 co-stars Al Pacino and Robert De Niro</a>, seems to have a bromance. But one that's been flying under the radar for far too long is the one between <a href=#>Succession's Nicholas Braun</a> and Superbad star Christopher Mintz-Plasse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While everyone has been wondering what happened to Christopher Mintz-Plasse after career-defining turn as McLovin in Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Emma Stone's hit coming-of-age comedy, Superbad. Even though the actor has actually been working steadily, it turns out that he's also been spending time with his best buddy, Cousin Greg. Here's the truth about Christopher and Nicholas' touching, hilarious, and totally entertaining bromance...</p><h2 id=the-succession-and-superbad-bromance-that-nobody-knew-about>The Succession And Superbad Bromance That Nobody Knew About</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to NME</a>, Nicholas Braun (AKA Cousin Greg on HBO's absolutely outstanding show, Succession) is so close with Christopher Mintz-Plasse that the two basically spent all of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown together. "We rode out the first month of chaos together," Mintz-Plasse told Page Six. "We were just sitting in my backyard talking through it in a very therapeutic way. It’s something we’re never going to forget."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We don't know exactly when the two met, but it seems likely that they became really close friends while filming the 2012-2013 canceled CBS sitcom, Friend Me. This show was supposed to be the next launchpad for Christopher's career but failed to find its legs. Nicholas, who was a working actor as well, was set to star in a supporting role. While the show didn't do much for either of their careers, it certainly appears to have done wonders for their personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A quick look at Christopher's or Nicholas' Instagram accounts will show that the two handsome and hilarious men spend A LOT of time together. Particularly during the lockdowns in Los Angeles in 2020, Nicholas and Christopher spent most of their time goofing around, pranking each other, having a few drinks, and cuddling up with the dogs. Nicholas and Christopher also both have a talent and interest in music, so there's no doubt that they spent many hours jamming together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Really Happened To Christopher Mintz-Plasse After 'Superbad'?</a></span></p><p>For those who wish that there was something else going on between Nicholas and Christopher, we have to disappoint you as Christopher's girlfriend, Britt Bowman, was also quarantining with them. But Christopher did help Nicholas set up his RAYA dating app profile, according to GQ. Although rumors have swirled about the true nature of their friendship, so much so that Christopher even made fun of it on his Instagram account. There's nothing going on between them. The guys just deeply love each other and that's a pretty touching thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Nicholas' most recent birthday, Christopher posted a series of photos on his Instagram with the caption, "A big rippin happy birthday to one of my nearest and dearest boys @nicholasbraun - and I think maybe my first on-screen kiss ❤️❤️" Christopher was referring to a scene in their canceled sitcom where the two of them (both shirtless) had to engage in a kiss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Nicholas Braun Really Feels About His Most Famous Scene In 'Succession'</a></span></p><p>In the photo set, Christopher and Nicholas can be seen enjoying a music festival together, dancing at a swanky event, and hanging out in each other's trailers on the set of Friend Me. Scrolling down both of their Instagram accounts also shows that the two went on a group vacation to Mexico in 2018 and went to Sasquatch festival in 2015.</p><h2 id=christopher-thinks-nicholas-and-kim-kardashian-would-be-a-great-couple>Christopher Thinks Nicholas And Kim Kardashian Would Be A Great Couple</h2><p>Whatever you may think of <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, there's no doubt that she only goes for a particular type of guy. And usually, that guy is outlandishly hunky and beyond confident. But Christopher claims that Nicholas would be a great replacement for Kim's ex-husband, <a href=#>Kanye West.</a> This came after the news of their divorce and Nicholas posting a video on Instagram basically telling Kim that he was interested in her romantically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Going through a divorce is never the best time to go after someone, but I really think … [Nicholas's] height will help him,"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Christopher told Page Six </a>of his 6 foot 7 friend... Yes, Nicholas is really THAT tall. "He’s very charming. So if they ever meet in person, yeah, I think they could hit it off."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Succession’ Actor Nicholas Braun Calls On Fans To Support Rock Opera</a></span></p><p>While it's unlikely that Nicholas will ever have a relationship with Kim, he'll always have another deeply authentic relationship in his life... Yes, he and Christopher are in it for the long haul. And fans are totally down to see the two stars in a few more projects together, hopefully, ones where we can see even more of their charming friendship on full display.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Awkward Thing Christopher Mintz-Plasse Had To Deal With When Filming 'Superbad'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6pLTRoqqtp6Cav265yKers2Wgoa60v8SsZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2strW0jKysnJuVqMCqu81mqq2ZomK7qq%2FHqKOaq12Xv6LBzWZm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./884043-total-divas-season-7-premiere-date-details-revealed-john-cena-copes-with-invisibility-video.html>&#171;&nbsp;Total Divas Season 7 Premiere Date &amp;amp; Details Revealed, John Cena Copes With Invisibility (Video)</a>
