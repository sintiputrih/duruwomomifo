The lyrics are bold and reveal her no-nonsense approach to life, especially when it comes to those who try to step in her way. She talks about her preference for cash and long hair, her ability to make a man hers with ease, and her disdain for those who copy her style. Through her powerful lyrics, the artist showcases her empowerment, and she makes it clear that she is no one to be messed with. In a nutshell, "Beef" is all about Flo Milli's unapologetic and self-assured attitude.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I like cash and my hair to my ass (I do)</u><br>I like to look good and make money.</p><br><p><u>Do the dash, can you make it go fast?
