Clayton was one of the 30 contestants competing in The Bachelorette Season 18 for a place in Michelle Young’s heart. Even though Michelle did not find Clayton worthy of being her boyfriend, the medical sales representative has got one more chance to find his love in the 26th season of The Bachelor.</p><p>Although The Bachelor 26 only premieres on January 3, 2022, the popular blogger Reality Steve has already revealed the final four in Clayton’s season of The Bachelor. One of them is an elementary school teacher and a model named Serene Russell.</p><h3><strong>Serene Russell On Bachelor 26</strong></h3><p>On November 3, Reality Steve took to Twitter to reveal the final 4 women who will be contesting for a place in Clayton’s heart.

In the same tweet, the blogger revealed that the filming of Susie’s hometown was completed on November 3rd and in a week Clayton would finish meeting the families of all four women including Serene’s.</p><p>Now that we know Serene makes it to the final 4 on Clayton’s season of The Bachelor, let’s talk about the odds of her coming out as a winner of this season. Based on some reports, the chances seem pretty null.</p><p>A sneak peek that premiered during Men Tell All episode in The Bachelorette Season 18 saw Clayton reveal that he is in love with three girls. Clayton also confessed to two women during a rose ceremony that he was intimate with two women.</p><p>He told, “I just want you to know that what I’m about to say is not gonna be easy to hear. I want to be fully, fully transparent, and I know it’s not easy to hear, but I was intimate with both of you.”</p><p>As soon as the latest sneak peek went on air, Bachelor Nation jumped off straight to Twitter to post their thoughts. One user wrote, “So I guess I don’t have to watch Clayton’s season of&nbsp;The Bachelor until fantasy suites, now that I know who the final 2 are! Why would you do that to us?,” whereas another one wrote, “Did they just show us the final 2 of Clayton’s season? I’m lost.”</p><p>On December 7, the leakster Reality Steve took to Twitter and confirmed that the final three are Susie, Rachel, and Gabby. Furthermore, the blogger also talked about hearing reports of Gabby and Rachel being the last two competing for Clayton’s heart.</p><p>Judging from the way things seem to be, it does not look like Serene makes it any further than the final four in Clayton’s season of The Bachelor.</p><h3><strong>Serene Russell Ethnicity</strong></h3><p>Most likely, Serene Russell is of mixed ethnicity.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Serene Russell Parents?</strong></h3><p>While we still have not figured out any information on Serene’s mom, her dad’s name is Bobby Russell.
