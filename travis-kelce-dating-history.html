However, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, the pro athlete was previously linked to Kayla Nicole (they go as far back as 2017), although the pair is <a href=#>no longer together</a>.</p><p>The sports star spoke about Kayla in December 2020, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, "She's the best. She's the absolute best." So who is the lucky lady who snagged Travis’s heart over the course of five years? According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, she’s a graduate of Pepperdine University who now works as an interviewer of professional athletes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The couple met on social media, with Kayla, who has also worked as a model, revealing, "He had been following me and insta-flirting for a few months.” They frequently hit red carpets together, and she has even developed a close friendship with Brittany, with the two WAGS previously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working out together</a> as recently as January of 2023. More on why that's somewhat scandalous in a moment.

The NFL star found love on the competition series, choosing Kentucky native <a href=#>Maya Benberry</a> in the end zone. Although he told his soon-to-be girlfriend she seemed somewhat arrogant and said during the finale, “I have been attracted to women like that my entire life, and those relationships didn't work because of that. I don't want that anymore.” Travis ultimately walked away with Maya, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But after eight months, the reality romance had fizzled, and Travis quickly moved on with Kayla.
