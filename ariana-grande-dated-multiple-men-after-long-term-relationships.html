According to Quinn, Grande may not hold particularly high standards for her partners and could be prone to rushing into relationships as soon as interest is expressed.</p><p>Quinn also noted that some individuals, including Grande, may enter into relationships hastily due to underlying feelings of insecurity about being alone. "People can rush into relationships when, deep down, they feel insecure about being alone. They can become addicted to the exciting first stages of romance, and simply overlook any red flags in their new partner."</p><p>She added, "This means if someone's already in a relationship, it might be viewed as an exciting part of the "chase" to finally being able to be together; rather than a warning sign about their trustworthiness."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ariana-grande-wearing-a-huge-dress.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ariana Grande's Most Successful Single Was A Disaster Behind The Scenes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ariana Grande has been sued and accused of plagiarizing the biggest song of her career.</span><p>In the long run, Quinn emphasized that lasting relationships must navigate periods of routine and require commitment even as the initial excitement wanes.
