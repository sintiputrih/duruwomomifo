infamous since the two got together. They’re notoriously open about their relationship, not to mention, they really know how to pack on the PDA, making sure the world knows just how in love they really are.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Both famous in their own right, Donnie a member of New Kids On The Block, and Jenny a model as well as radio and TV personality, you can’t help but wonder how these two big personalities got together. Whatever they found in each other, really makes them work. As mushy and sickening as they can be, we really can’t help but love Donnie and Jenny.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>These are 15 little known facts about Donnie Wahlberg and Jenny McCarthy’s relationship.</span></p><h2 id=they-were-introduced-by-andy-cohen><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>They Were Introduced By Andy Cohen</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>With two huge personalities like Jenny and Donnie’s, you often wonder how the two of them even met. They were first <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced</a> to one another by Andy Cohen on his show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Watch What Happens Live</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Donnie was then a guest in Jenny’s VH1 show, filming flirty segments together. The two hit it off from the very beginning, flirting with each other non-stop. The rest was history!</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-waited-a-bit-to-start-dating><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>They Waited A Bit To Start Dating</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Although they hit it off from the very beginning, Donnie played it cool for a while, not pursuing Jenny <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately</a>. He let some time pass — two whole weeks to be exact before he reached out to her again, asking Jenny on a first official date. After that, the two were inseparable.</span></p><h2 id=they-got-engaged-quickly><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>They Got Engaged Quickly</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>We know that Jenny and Donnie have a lot of chemistry together, it’s how the two of them hit it off so quickly. The two met in March of 2013, and things got serious between them really fast. In fact, in April 2014, a little over a year later, Donnie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed</a> and the two were officially engaged.</span></p><h2 id=it-was-a-cute-proposal><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>It Was A Cute Proposal</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Donnie’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proposal</a> to Jenny was a rather cute and creative one. He enlisted the help of Jenny’s son, Evan. Evan brought his mom several cards that spelled out “will you marry,” before leaving the room and coming back wearing a shirt saying “me?” with Donnie and the ring. Of course, with a cute proposal like that, she couldn’t say no!</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-had-a-surprisingly-small-ceremony><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Had A Surprisingly Small Ceremony</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jenny and Donnie finally tied the knot on August 31, 2014, in the Hotel Barker in St. Charles, Illinois. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding</a> was far from over the top, as the couple wanted to keep the whole thing small and intimate. They only invited close family and friends, having about 90 guests in total. The ceremony itself was short, sweet, and to the point, lasting only about 20 minutes.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Sketchy Things Everyone Ignores About The Wahlberg Family</a></span></p><h2 id=they-had-an-interesting-wedding-party><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Had An Interesting Wedding Party</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even though the ceremony was short, and the wedding itself rather small, they had quite the interesting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding party</a>. Jenny’s son, Evan walked her down the aisle, while Donnie had his New Kids on the Block bandmates Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Danny Wood, and Jonathan Knight as his groomsmen.</span></p><h2 id=he-helped-pick-out-her-dress><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Helped Pick Out Her Dress</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>We all know by now that Jenny and Donnie are far from the normal couple. Both of them have been married before, so they decided to keep things a little less traditional. Donnie actually had a hand in picking out Jenny’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dress</a> for the big day. Clearly they didn’t mind that the groom shouldn’t see the dress as a tradition!</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-know-what-they-want-from-each-other><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Know What They Want From Each Other</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since the two hit it off from the very start, and got engaged and married rather quickly, it’s pretty safe to say that the two know what they want, and that’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">each other</a>. They’ve said that the fact that they’ve both been married and in serious relationships multiple times, they know what they want, and if that’s the case, why wait? The two are still going strong today.</span></p><h2 id=they-had-a-reality-show><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Had A Reality Show</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Like many other celebrity couples, Jenny and Donnie had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reality show </a>at one point. The show premiered in January of 2015, and gave fans a look into their relationship and their private lives. The show ran for three seasons before ultimately coming to an end in April of 2016.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Most Underrated Reality Shows You Forgot Existed</a></span></p><h2 id=they-re-attached-at-the-hip><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They're Attached At The Hip</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>With a bond like theirs, it’s not really surprising to hear that the two of them are pretty much <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attached at the hip.</a> Of course, due to work obligations, they do have to spend time apart, but when they’re not working, you can count on the two of them to be together. Jenny has even joked that she follows him around the house.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-live-in-chicago><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Live In Chicago</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Obviously, you’ll find most celebrities living in Los Angeles, or even New York City, but Donnie and Jenny? They have a home in the cozy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago</a> suburbs. They both have work in New York a few days a week, so they’ll fly out for a few days and then fly back to their Chicago home. It might seem unconventional, but it’s what works for them.</span></p><h2 id=they-don-t-want-kids><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Don't Want Kids</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Both Jenny and Donnie have been married before, both of them having children with their exes. When they got married, they sat down and decided if they wanted to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kids</a> together. After some discussion, they decided that they were happy as they were, and they weren’t going to have any kids of their own.</span></p><h2 id=they-have-a-blended-family><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Have A Blended Family</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Once Jenny and Donnie married, their families became one, and they had their own new <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blended</a> family. Jenny has a son from her previous marriage, Evan, while Donnie has two kids with his ex-wife, Elijah and Xavier. Like any other family, it took some time to adjust, but now they’re one big happy family.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Photos Of Divorced Celeb Moms That Are Not So Wholesome</a></span></p><h2 id=they-got-the-fan-approval><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Got The Fan Approval</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>With a fan base like Donnie’s, they’re heavily involved with everything he does, and have been since he was just starting out in New Kids On The Block. Jenny knew this, and embraced all of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans</a>. That was the best thing she could ever do, as the fans absolutely love Jenny, and her relationship with Donnie.</span></p><h2 id=they-renew-their-vows-every-year><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Renew Their Vows Every Year</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two are so in love with one another that they decided that every year on their wedding anniversary that they would start a new tradition — renewing their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vows</a>. They’ve done so every year, and plan on keeping this as a tradition every year.</span></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Most Uncomfortable Photos Of Jenny McCarthy And Donnie Wahlberg's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWcnsG1uMRmoqenp6N6p63CrapmmZKkwrV5yZ6lp7FdorCkrdGtn7JlkaOxbrDOp6WinV2srqm4wZ6poKtdp7KtrdOipqermJ69cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./1nonly-age-revealed-how-old-is-1nonly.html>&#171;&nbsp;1nonly Age Revealed: How Old Is 1nonly?</a>
