The actor has been linked to several famous women in the past.</p><p class=dh>Édgar Ramírez was born in Caracas, Venezuela on March 25, 1977. His acting career began in the early 2000s and had a breakthrough into Hollywood in 2005's "Domino," starring Mickey Rourke and Keira Knightley. His career has progressed quickly since then, and he currently has over 40 films to his credit.</p><p class=dh>With a booming professional career, the actor's love life has been in the spotlight for several years, but nothing concrete has been established. He has posted pictures of himself with many women on his social media, but no romantic links have been confirmed.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Édgar Once Reunited with an On-Screen Wife</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Ramírez once had <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/jennifer-garner-and-movie-husband-edgar-ramirez-have-surprise-reunion-on-plane/>a surprise reunion</a> with his "Yes Day" <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8521876/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">co-star</a> <a class="me a" href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> on an airplane in December 2022. Garner shared a photo of the two smiling actors on the plane and explained that she had gotten onto the plane when she realized Ramírez was seated directly in front of her. What a coincidence!</p><p class=dh>The pair were husband and wife with two children, played by <a class="me a" href=#>Jenna Ortega</a> and Julian Lerner, in the Netflix comedy which premiered in 2021. Their two on-screen kids expressed delight in seeing their "parents" together again. Ortega <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cmcg5t9yzW7/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=90ef9547-e0c5-4da0-9da4-af26ec84f98b">commented</a>, "You're kidding!!!!" while Lerner <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cmcg5t9yzW7/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=90ef9547-e0c5-4da0-9da4-af26ec84f98b">wrote</a>, "No Way!!!! That's awesome! Hola Familia!"</p><p class=dh>Ramírez enjoyed his time making the movie, describing <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1183149/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">his first comedy</a> as a beautiful experience. In the film, he and Garner let their children make the rules for a day which sets up the wildest 24 hours filled with fun and adventure for the family of four.</p><p class=dh>It seems the actor has warmed up to the comedy genre as he stars in another Netflix comedy, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/florida-man-edgar-ramirez-abbey-lee-interview>a 2023 series</a> called "Florida Man." Ramírez plays Mike Valentine, a former police officer who returns to his home state to solve a case. <a class="me a" href=#>Jason Bateman</a> serves as one of the show's executive producers.</p><p class=dh>An exciting subplot of the show is Valentine's romance with a mob boss' runaway girlfriend, Delly West, played by Abbey Lee, the person he is sent to look for. The pair's incredible chemistry left some memorable sexy moments for the audience and the two actors, whose great connection made them feel like they had known each other for years.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Édgar Appears to Be Single but Posts Photos with Women Often</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Regarding his love life, the 46-year-old hunk is not known to be in a relationship with anyone. This is despite his seemingly frequently flirtatious interactions with women, from fellow celebrities to everyday, unidentified ladies. His Instagram has evidence of several instances when he is in the company of beautiful women.</p><p class=dh>In May 2022, Ramírez shared photos of an intimate moment he shared with Swedish actress Noomi Rapace on the red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival at Hôtel Martinez. He included a sweet <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CdswkfPD_EX/>caption</a>, "The apple of my life @noomirapace. Sharing this honor with you is everything. I love you."</p><p class=dh>Two months later, Ramírez posted more snaps of him in close proximity to two ladies. The first was captioned "[L]ove is…" and had a gorgeous woman with her hand over his shoulder, looking like she was about to kiss his cheek. In the second, the actor is <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CgSeSpSjWhP/>standing next to a sexy woman</a> in a red dress next to the waterfront.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Édgar Was Linked to Several Famous Women Before</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The discussion about who the actor's partner is has been going on for quite some time to no avail. Ramirez has been <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/edgar-ramirez-wife>linked to several famous women</a> over the years but has never responded to the rumors.</p><p class=dh>Among the most notable of those alleged love stories include his friendship with Cuban actress <a class="me a" href=#>Ana De Armas</a>. The two became acquainted during a cast reading of "Hands of Stone," which Robert De Niro had organized in 2013. However, neither party ever spoke about any romantic relationship between them.</p><p class=dh>Ramírez has also had a slight brush with reality television, as he was once linked to <a class="me a" href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a>. The speculation stemmed from a flirty exchange the pair had on Instagram after she raved about her love for "The Undoing." Nevertheless, their moment appears to have been nothing more than a flirtation.</p><p class=dh>Another of the famous faces the actor was linked to was fellow Venezuelan Marisa Roman after she welcomed him to Argentina in 2017 via Instagram. The post showed Ramírez kissing her neck while she closed her eyes alongside a suspiciously dreamy caption, "Ed is in town … Only magic can happen!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1nbGppbHqlu8SsZJ6cl5a%2Fbr7ApqCrnapitaLCxGaYZq%2BZm7JutMRmoKxlnqTBb7TTpqM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./genie-bouchard.html>&#171;&nbsp;Genie Bouchard - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a>
