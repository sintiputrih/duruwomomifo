Together with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/how-far-did-gary-player-drive-the-golf-ball>Gary Player</a>, they formed the “Big Three” in the 1960s and their exploits transformed the game of golf – they were big business! They were the first idols of the TV age and countless young golfers were inspired to pick up a club by their scintillating play and consummate professionalism. Both Nicklaus and Palmer enjoyed tremendous success both on and off the golf course. How did their careers compare?</p><h2 id=majors-3>Majors</h2><figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p>In men’s professional golf Jack Nicklaus leads the way in Major performances.

Jack won The Open Championship on three occasions and the PGA Championship five times. He is a six-time Masters champion, most recently in 1986. His Major-winning career spanned an incredible 24 years.</p><p>Arnold Palmer won seven Major titles over a much shorter span of time – between 1958 and 1964.

Nicklaus’ Ryder Cup record was 17-8-3. He won 66% of the games he played in. Nicklaus was twice Ryder Cup captain, a winning one in 1983 and a losing one in 1987.</p><p>Arnold Palmer was always on the winning team in the six Ryder Cups he played in and the one in which he was non-playing captain (1975). He first played in 1961, was playing captain in 1963 and last played in 1973. His playing record was 22-8-2.
