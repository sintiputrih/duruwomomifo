However, on the show, he has yet to land a steady gig that actually makes him any money.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So we have to ask — is Florian really a model on Darcey & Stacey? The fact that he isn't actively working during Season 4 makes it seem like he's struggling in his career of choice. There's even a point where Darcey and Stacey's friend Michael Benz lectures Florian about working and helping to support himself and Stacey. But that could be because Florian's career isn't as successful as he and Stacey originally let on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Florian really a model on 'Darcey & Stacey'?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, Florian is a fashion and fitness model. Viewers have seen him take headshots on Darcey & Stacey. However, he hasn't actually gotten a job as a model while on the show. His Instagram profile does feature plenty of professional photos of the model, so you can't say he isn't trying to attract attention from brands that may want to work with him.</p><p>The only problem is, these all look like photos meant for Florian's portfolio rather than pictures for a campaign. He is a model for House of Eleven, but that's also his wife's company, so we aren't sure we can count that as work for the Albania native.</p><p>When Stacey originally met Florian, before he moved to the U.S., he was believed to be a model in Albania. It looks like he's having a hard time getting his career back up off the ground, though.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>That could change now that Florian got himself a new set of teeth. Viewers were quick to notice that his previously dull-colored teeth with wide gaps were replaced by impossibly straight, white ones, in the Season 4 premiere. Florian has tagged the dental company that made the transformation happen in multiple social media posts and it could be part of an effort to get work as a model.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Florian says he wants to open a furniture store.</h2><p>Florian once revealed plans on Darcey & Stacey to open a furniture store. His family was in a similar business back home, so that makes sense for him. Before now, the topic hadn't come up again. But in a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Florian and Stacey revealed that he's getting serious about pursuing a career in that field rather than modeling. Or, at the very least, in addition to modeling.</p><p>He shared with the outlet that he's putting things together little by little to start a company similar to the one his father ran. As of now, it doesn't look like Florian has officially opened a store or lent his name to a furniture line but, Stacey said in the interview, "You gotta start somewhere."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michael Benz has lectured Florian about finding a job.</h2><p>Michael is Darcey and Stacey's close friend who is unafraid to insert himself in their affairs, should the situation call for it. So when he sees Stacey worrying about Florian's lack of a job now that he can legally work in the U.S., he takes it upon himself to confront Florian about it directly.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course Florian has an immediate issue with this. He doesn't think it's Michael's business when and how he finds a job and he doesn't appreciate being lectured by him. And as of now on Darcey & Stacey, Florian has yet to find a full-time job or modeling gig.</p><p>At one point on the show, Stacey complains that Florian wants to find ways to cut back on their <a href=#>wedding</a> expenses, so he takes her to a public park to consider it as a venue. He also doesn't outright agree to her chosen venue when they learn how costly it is. To his credit, at least Florian has the drive to be frugal without an income of his own at the moment.</p><p>Watch Darcey & Stacey on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBussuoqaKZnmK%2Fpq3LpbBmmV2ivKWxy2abmqqTmsZurc2dZKyskZiyug%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pesto-panini-with-fresh-mozzarella-and-tomato.html>&#171;&nbsp;Pesto Panini with Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Modern Honey</a>
