Negotiations stalled at first, especially because while the young R&B star had a great voice, the songs he was performing weren't great.</p><p>In a years-ago interview, Tina Davis, who first met Chris while he was trying to secure a contract with Def Jam Recordings, explained that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she immediately knew that he had talent</a>.</p><p>Blending her expertise with Chris' raw vocal talent would be a great opportunity, but it took some time (and Davis getting fired from Def Jam Recordings after a merger) before Chris signed with Jive instead.</p><p>Chris, who was 16 at the time of the interview (in 2006), spoke about studying while working on his career, and discussed his idea of heading to college to at least get a degree before continuing his rise to fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-worked-closely-with-his-manager-in-his-early-career>Chris Worked Closely With His Manager In His Early Career</h2><p>In that interview with SF Gate, the publication highlighted that Tina Davis was managing Chris along with his mom, Joyce Hawkins.
