small&nbsp; Texas suburb, the story follows the shenanigans of upperclassmen chasing booze and a good time. It's not all fun and games as they also haze the incoming freshman, most notably Mitch,&nbsp;whos older sister asked the boys to "go easy on him," and the graduating junior high kids' attempted escape.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Lowest-Grossing Milla Jovovich Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Many prominent actors got started in this film, whether they had a big role or a bit part. Here is the cast of Dazed and Confused, ranked by net worth.</p><h2 id=jason-london-800-000>Jason London, $800,000</h2><p>Born in San Diego, California Jason London played Randall "Pink" Floyd, the more sensitive football player, who refuses to sign a pledge to abstain from drugs over the summer. He is much more compassionate to the junior high boys and actually does go easy on Mitch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also takes him on his first night out, sharing some drugs and alcohol with the incoming freshman. London actually has a twin brother named Jeremy, and he has had many appearances in film and television like 7th Heaven, Grey's Anatomy and NCIS.</p><h2 id=anthony-rapp-2-million>Anthony Rapp, $2 Million</h2><p>You know him as one member of the intellectual trio, deciding to slum it and join in on the beer drinking and drug-taking fun for the evening, Tony. Anthony Rapp, however, has had a long, impressive career on stage and onscreen.</p><p>He's an actor and singer, who began at age six, but got his big break originating the role of Mark Cohen in Rent, starring on Broadway and in the movie version. He was also in Six Degrees of Separation, Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, and Star Trek: Discovery.</p><h2 id=joey-lauren-adams-2-million>Joey Lauren Adams, $2 Million</h2><p>Joey Lauren Adams played Pink's enthusiastic and sultry girlfriend, Simone. Funnily enough, she played the ex-girlfriend of Jeremy London'(Jason London's identical twin brother) in Kevin Smith's classic movie, Mallrats. Joey Lauren Adams is originally from Little Rock Arkansas, but she moved to sunny Los Angeles at the age of 20.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Expensive Restaurants In Los Angeles</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then went on to play in many other movies and TV series like United States of Tara, Big Daddy, Party Down, Coneheads, and several Kevin Smith movies like Chasing Amy, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Mallrats.</p><h2 id=rory-cochrane-3-million>Rory Cochrane, $3 Million</h2><p>Rory Cochrane was born in Syracuse New York, and but grew up in England. After he started acting in high school, Cochrane eventually began landing small parts in films. You likely recognize him as Slater, the iconic burnout looking for a good time in Dazed and Confused. He gave us some of the most famous musings of the movie, like his take on the dollar bill.</p><p>Since the film, Cochrane had numerous roles including playing the father in Oculus, Dogtown, and his roles in TV series' 24 and CSI: Miami.</p><h2 id=adam-goldberg-3-million>Adam Goldberg, $3 Million</h2><p>Adam Goldberg is originally from Santa Monica, California and played the wisecracking but slightly neurotic Mike, who is out with his trio of intellectual friends trying to have a good night out on the last night before the summer officially begins. Goldberg has gone on to have a long career in TV and film, with parts in a few hit TV series' such as Friends, The Jim Gaffigan Show, Entourage, and Joey. He also played impressive roles in movies with critical acclaim such as Saving Private Ryan, and Zodiac.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marissa-ribisi-10-million>Marissa Ribisi, $10 Million</h2><p>Marissa Ribisi was born in Los Angeles, California and is part of a Hollywood family. Like Jason London, she too has a twin brother who is a&nbsp;very recognizable&nbsp;character actor, Giovanni Ribisi. Marissa Ribisi played the character Cynthia in Dazed and Confused, and she made up the third part of the intellectual bunch, though she seems the most eager let go of her inhibitions and join in on the fun.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Crazy Details You Never Knew About The Olsen Twins' Career</a></span></p><p>Ribisi went on to act in some other well-liked films like Pleasantville, The Brady Bunch Movie and Wild Horses.</p><h2 id=parker-posey-10-million>Parker Posey, $10 Million</h2><p>Parker Posey was born in Baltimore, Maryland and became popular for her part in many indie films in the '90s. You may recognize her as the conniving, hazing obsessed Darla in Dazed and Confused, who graced us with the iconic phrase "wipe that face off your head, you dumb b***h!"</p><p>Parker Posey went on to play other famous roles like lisping Lisa in Josey and the Pussycats, the main character in Party Girl and her roles in the mostly improvised, hilarious mockumentaries A Mighty Wind and Best in Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=milla-jovovich-40-million>Milla Jovovich, $40 Million</h2><p>Milla Jovovich was born in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, and moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of 5. She began acting and modeling as a young girl and shortly after began&nbsp;appearing in movies.</p><p>Her early role as Michelle in Dazed and Confused is definitely an "I can't believe that's her!" type of moment. She plays the free-spirited, guitar playing stoner girl who speaks little throughout the movie. Jovovich went on to star in some noteworthy movies like The 5th Element, the Resident Evil franchise, and A Perfect Getaway.</p><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughy-95-million>Matthew McConaughy, $95 Million</h2><p>Although it was a smaller role, Matthew McConaughey played&nbsp;the too old, 20 something-year-old guy that is for some reason still hanging out with high schoolers, supplying them with beer, participating in the hazing and trying to pick up young girls. Though his character is actually quite creepy in retrospect, we can admit he gave us some killer lines, like the legendary, "Alright, alright, alright."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Expensive Beers In The World</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew McConaughey has starred in many roles since Dazed and Confused like Dallas Buyers Club, Magic Mike, Interstellar, Tropic Thunder, and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-130-million>Ben Affleck, $130 Million</h2><p>Ben Affleck also had a less than attractive character in Dazed and Confused. He played O'bannion, the senior that is so angry about being held back a second time that he makes it his mission to find the incoming freshman and take his frustration out on them.</p><p>Affleck was born in Berkeley, California and went on to have a long career onscreen. He had a turn at playing Batman, had several turns in Kevin Smith movies like Dogma, Chasing Amy and Mallrats and continues to act in and make films.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Culturally Influential Movies Of The 1990s</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5npJ2ybq%2FArKtmp5ZisaLGxJ1kmqaUYrCwusWuqp6cXaeur7fEnWSbsV2jsrV51qipraBf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-omegaverse-the-new-bl-anime-explained.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is Omegaverse?
