Written in 1930, but not implemented until four years later, this set of rules was generally intended to keep movies from “corrupting” the people who watched them. Given that homosexuality was considered either a physical or psychological malady in the early 20th century, the code effectively legislated any limited queer presence out of existence. While homosexuality was not explicitly banned in the Hays’ text, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was mandated </a>that “no picture shall be produced that will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience should never be thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin.” It was also codified that only “correct standards of life” should be presented,” and that “sex perversion or any inference to it is forbidden.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuh7oq100143i60g2mrvrgr@published data-word-count=41>In other words, for a long time, cinematic queers were pushed underground, relegated to existing only in subtext — and most often as villains. In order to get queer stories onscreen, filmmakers had to find creative ways to subvert the system.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuh7oq300153i6080mlaqm3@published data-word-count=146>Horror films in particular have made for a fascinating case study in the evolving perceptions of queer presence; queer-horror filmmakers and actors were often forced to lean into the trope of the “predatory queer” or the “monstrous queer” to claim some sense of power through visibility and blatant expressions of sexuality. Below is a beginner’s guide to the most essential queer horror of the past 90 years. It also doubles as a timeline of the evolution of queer horror: How LGBTQA themes and characters went from hiding between the lines in movies with “gay sensibilities” in the 1930s to breaking out as Pride memes almost a century later — going from invisible (lesbian ghosts!) to closeted (literally, in the case of Dorian Gray) to fabulously out (who wouldn’t have given in to Catherine Deneuve’s Miriam Blaylock?), before finally being allowed to exist as multidimensional characters onscreen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuh7qgg00253i60ynhv2dj8@published data-word-count=26>From the coded abominations of James Whale’s taboo-skirting films of the 1930s to the Pride reign of The Babadook, here’s our guide to queer horror cinema.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjiuh9hyr00293i60hinrf072@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The 1930s and 1940s — Fear the Queer Monsters</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuh7oyd00193i607k1pbkcy@published data-word-count=180>Queerness was codified as taboo when the Hays Code went into effect in 1934. But at the same time, the public was hungry for fantastical stories of monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Invisible Man, and so on — all of which are convenient avatars for the socially ostracized, the misunderstood, and the disenfranchised. As Harry M. Benshoff explains in his book Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality in the Horror Film, “Immediately before and during the years of World War II, Universal Studio’s horror films began to employ a more humanistic depiction of their monsters,” and the films of Val Lewton, like Cat People, reflected “a growing awareness of homosexuality, homosexual communities, and the dynamics of homosexual oppression as it was played out in society and the military.” So even though Hollywood execs refused to show explicit queerness, during the first true horror boom in American cinema, they were willing to pay for stories about social outcasts and sexually nonnormative figures. Horror fans thus found themselves awash in some of the genre’s most iconic queer-coded characters of all time.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxax8u6o00fq3b8266zyxm9r@published>The Old Dark House (1932)</h2><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-5HkxaX9X"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, and More: A Hammer Horror Primer</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuhotni00123i60l33l7aj6@published data-word-count=118>It should come as no surprise that a known gay director, James Whale, brought to life some of the most iconic Universal Monsters during their peak in the 1930s. Whale imbued his movies, often about the ultimate outsiders, with a gay sensibility: In Dark House, five people are brought together when they’re forced off the road by a storm and end up taking shelter in the same isolated home. Taboo topics like homosexual behavior, androgyny, and sexual deviance are all hinted at throughout the movie. Whale also cast the famously campy actor Ernest Thesiger to play one of the Femm siblings. This is an Ur-text for haunted-house cinema — and one of the gayest films of its decade.<br><strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c62/0ad/2a01bfaec3730e707824a9196eea3cdcab-19-queer-horror.rsquare.w400.jpg><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxax97t600fv3b82stlfznua@published>The Bride of Frankenstein (1935)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuiirt0004g3i60fconvyuo@published data-word-count=132>Whale also directed a sequel to his hit Frankenstein, this time using the scheming Dr. Septimus Pretorius to entice Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) back into his laboratory after the events of the first film.<strong> </strong>Through Thesiger’s high-camp portrayal, Pretorius plays as one of the most identifiably gay characters in an era where explicitly acknowledging that fact was banned. And ultimately, the monster himself ends up the selfless hero, which became something of a trope in early horror: As Benshoff writes in Monsters in the Closet,<strong> </strong>“Many eschewed the ‘normal’ couple all together and instead focused solely on their queer protagonists, suggesting, as will the horror films of later decades, that it is the monster queer whom the audience really comes to see and identify with, and not the heterosexual heroes and heroines.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxax9rw200g03b82o1ppqgip@published>Dracula’s Daughter (1936)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxaxa3mp00g53b82uzje2opi@published data-word-count=120>Several decades before the lesbian-vampire boom of the 1970s, there was Dracula’s Daughter, centered on a character desperate to shed the disease of vampirism and live freely as a normal woman (meaning: under the thumb of a controlling man). The Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden) seduces her victims — of both genders — to drain them of their blood. She battles “horrible impulses” that she tries and fails to repress, and even starts seeing a psychiatrist to analyze the “vampire” out of her (a treatment that was thought to cure homosexuality, as well). Although she was yet another queer villain, she was more sympathetic to 1930s audiences due to her desire to be purged of what made her an Other.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxaxad8o00ga3b82qpz2fpwc@published>Rebecca (1940)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxaxvbrd00gf3b825clrg7oi@published data-word-count=111>Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier and adapted by Alfred Hitchcock, Rebecca tells the story of a common-born girl who marries above her station and is forced to live in the larger-than-life shadow of her new man’s dead wife, Rebecca.

Almost 80 years later, Mrs. Danvers remains one of the great coded queer icons of all time.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxaxvmq800gk3b82e273ftbw@published>Cat People (1942)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxaxw9wt00gs3b82ni3vvv1b@published data-word-count=99>Legendary producer Val Lewton brought forth Cat People, the story of a Serbian immigrant named Irena who must abstain from intimacy, lest she awaken the curse of her descendants, which doomed the women of her tribe to transform into murderous panthers should their desire be awakened. Irena meets and hastily marries an American man, but she fears giving into him physically; her reluctance is broadly read among critics to be coded, repressed lesbian desire. In addition to being an outsider in America with different customs and traditions, Irena is further alienated by her inability to consummate her heteronormative marriage.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxaxwgo600gx3b829vnsptxf@published>The Uninvited (1944)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxaxx1m200h73b82n95x5egj@published data-word-count=154>The concept of invisible queers went from figurative to literal in this haunted-house film, where the coded lesbian character is actually a full-on ghost! A brother and sister move into a seaside mansion haunted by a woman scornfully tethered to this mortal coil by a desire for vengeance and a connection to her implied lesbian lover. The relationship of the protagonist, Stella, with the mysterious ghost she thinks is her mother, begins as an infatuation that’s been interpreted as subtextually queer. “The heroine’s fascination is directly identified as love,”<a href=#> writes Patricia White</a> in Uninvited: Classical Hollywood Cinema and Lesbian Representability, “But the condition of this unveiling is that the object of her attraction becomes literally her mother. The film thus dramatizes how the female oedipal narrative functions as a support for another story, a lesbian desire that is both evoked and covered over.” A classic tale of haunting. A classic tale of gay erasure!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f64/570/7f315efe11dbc5cdbe7922bcb660edbc8a-bride-of-frankenstein-secondary.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxaxxc0800hc3b82dy9l4hmy@published>The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuio961004l3i60pbf86wi2@published data-word-count=74><strong></strong>Dorian Gray is a man of broad sexual appetites (at one point, he’s referred to as “bestial, sodden, and unclean”) who has a secret so dark it must be locked away in a closet so no one can ever see his true visage, which is twisted and grotesque.

And then there were the atomic fears that gave way to strange invaders and oddities of science, like Teenage Caveman, Teenage Monster, Teenage Zombie, and Them!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuh7oya00173i60ha63nzww@published data-word-count=100>But the ’50s also laid the foundation for the coming post-code era. “The qualified compassion that had been directed towards queer monsters during the years of World War II evaporated in the blazing heat of McCarthyism; a new paranoia surrounding difference, be it political or sexual, added to a socially oppressive atmosphere that fueled not only greater social persecution of homosexuals, but also, conversely, the beginnings of an organized homosexual civil rights movement,” writes Benshoff. A burgeoning Cold War — combined with atomic fears and adherence to cookie-cutter conventions — made for a lot of very thinly veiled queer horror.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dd8/36b/1f4f226a039e19e080372fc708f2d8bfba-picture-of-dorian-gray.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxax88bg00fl3b82tw8jv60e@published>The Creature From the Black Lagoon (1954)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuh7oyd001a3i60uqcockx4@published data-word-count=87>Black Lagoon is ostensibly about a group of scientists on an expedition to South America investigating a possible new species, and finding the shocking Gill-man. Upon a closer reading, though, it’s about handful of men sharing a homo-social excursion wherein they encounter a large, amphibian-like phallic symbol.

Brandon suggests regressive hypnotherapy to find the root of Tony’s impulses within his subconscious so it can be neutralized (similar to regressive treatments at the time that were recommended for weeding out and eliminating homosexual desire), but accessing those early-stage memories of course just unleashes the boy’s inner beast, instead.

Similarly, on the queer horror front, lesbian vampires were about to turn from shame-filled figures like the Countess Marya Zaleska into sexually forward predators, and a real, actual lesbian character — not a ghost or a suggestion of one — would appear as a protagonist in The Haunting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxax237u00eq3b82igcbd1mx@published data-word-count=70>At the same time, TV shows like Bewitched and The Addams Family turned monsters into your kooky next-door neighbors, putting a stronger emphasis on human evil in the form of villains like Norman Bates — and even Frankenstein’s monster would assume an attractive human form in Frankenstein Created Woman.

This isn’t just great queer horror. <a href=#>It’s great horror full stop</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxasytkt003x3b82c5tr6dz8@published>What Keeps You Alive (2018)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjiuh7qc900243i60ul8bi9cb@published data-word-count=223>This story of murder and revenge balances the historically problematic aspects of contemporary lesbian roles in horror with the progressive elements ushered in by New Queer Cinema and a broadened queer cultural presence. It’s a lesbian thriller for the modern era, about two women celebrating their wedding anniversary at a remote cabin when one of them is exposed as a serial liar and potential serial killer. The two leads are sexual without being overtly sexualized. The antagonist conforms to the archetype of the lethal lesbian (and most definitely qualifies as a “problem subject”), but in a fully gay context — she isn’t being assessed against heterosexual norms. She is simply an antagonist in a horrifying context, as opposed to a monstrous queer. Meanwhile, the film’s protagonist exceeds the limits of the “passive object,” with a narrative arc that allows her to turn from a helpless victim into an agent of her own salvation. Like Lestat and Louis<strong> </strong>in Interview With the Vampire, Jules and Sarah together allow the salacious delights of past horror tropes to exist and be elevated by the increased nuance of horror in the 21st century — because the genre is at its best when filmmakers understand the past well enough to tear out the junk, keep the good stuff, and incorporate a modern sensibility that keeps horror moving forward.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxagu9d6000j3b82kbkkacu5@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>2020s — Drag Queens, Trans Horror, and Ambient Queerness</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxah86ka000s3b821d0txbr2@published data-word-count=177>As time marches forward, the pace of history being made quickens. More is compressed into shorter spans of time as information races around the world in the actual blink of an eye. Where elder millennials may still feel a tear well up in their eyes at the sight of a queer hero actually living through a slasher, those who were reared on TikTok have come to expect nothing less. It’s still the early 2020s, and the search for examples of LGBTQ horror no longer requires a decoder ring and magnifying glass. There are choices now. We don’t have to like everything simply because we are subsisting on scraps. The options for queer genre fans are no longer the realm of film festivals and foreign titles that dare to whisper secrets into the ears of eager, searching viewers. Queer metaphor can still be abundant, but this time it can be textually out characters spinning up meta-textually dense allegories. It’s homos all the way down, and the monster is normatively now, baby. Even the cis people can see it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxahe0py000x3b82rv9ynvks@published data-word-count=199>Jane Schoenbrun is creating movies for the coolest studio in town. The lip-smacking sound of a girl-on-girl makeout can be the opening moments of a major theatrical release and feel more fun than it does revolutionary, and the biggest distribution platform in the world can put out an entire slasher trilogy that revolves around a lesbian romance. At a time when the rights of trans folks are being relentlessly assailed and the highest court in the land is intoning that legal precedents ensuring gay marriage may no longer be safe, genre cinema will play the vital role it always has in rendering our gravest societal fears and anxieties with all the blood and bile and body horror they deserve. The movies below are a sampling of how far horror has come in the span of a micro-generation, and they will document our present terrors like a time capsule for future viewers. The war for more full representation has not been won, and frankly, it never will be. Old villains will reanimate like zombies and new ones will form like mega Deadites come to wipe out your whole family — chosen or otherwise. Thankfully, nobody fights back like the queers.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxahes3200193b82fxz92g44@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Titane " href=#>Titane </a>(2021)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxahx8g4001e3b82e1nzf80l@published data-word-count=124><a href=#>Julia Ducournau </a>blasted the door apart on her way into the horror world with Raw, and then she blew the whole house up around her with its follow-up, Titane. A tall, stunning, and conventionally femme-presenting French woman, Ducournau emphasized her outlook on the world as “more fluid every day, in so many ways,” when asked about the role of gender and transition in Titane. Those topics are <a href=#>central to her movie</a>, of course, but no more than they are to her regular considerations of life and art. So it was only natural that her Palm d’Or–winning sophomore effort reflects such explorations. The point,<a href=#> Ducournau says</a>, “was to create a new humanity that is strong because it’s monstrous — and not the other way around.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxahzn9d001j3b82q6mn4yd8@published data-word-count=213>And so, Titane’s queerness is baked in at a genetic level. A “teenage boy” is walking around pregnant with the offspring of a Cadillac inside them. Our hero(ine) starts the movie on a killing spree that begins as righteous defense against patriarchal domination before turning into an irrational, animalistic survival play. The queer protagonist is impulsive and cruel, but also vulnerable and afraid. Good and bad is a useless binary in the world of Titane, as an assault victim becomes a femme fatale before turning into a frightened fugitive searching for safe haven, and her salvation comes in the form of a jacked middle-aged man who tenderly adopts her as his long-lost son after she shaves her head and takes a boy’s name — a chosen family born from the idea of a biological one. In her review of the film for Autostraddle, <a href=#>Drew Burnett Gregory wrote</a>, “We say we want to destroy binaries — well here is a film that does just that. Male and female. Straight and gay. Trans and cis. Truth and lies. Flesh and metal.” Ducournau set a bar for queer horror to strive toward for the rest of the 2020s, through no less of an endeavor than forging a new humanity though the monstrous. Happy pride to that.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxaiuomr001s3b821gkkfnju@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Fear Street Trilogy" href=#>Fear Street Trilogy</a> (2021)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxaivenj001y3b82ppkb3jci@published data-word-count=83>Horror is likely the most franchised genre in all of cinema. Sagas can stretch on for decades through reboots and reimagining and “requels,” and very occasionally through long, continuous, unbroken mythologies (way to go, Chucky!). Super-killers like Jason have become juiced-up sci-fi killing machines in space. Leatherface has been re-introduced over and over. Scream cemented the viability of dual final girls. But no other horror series distributed by a major-industry behemoth has revolved around a gay couple in love before Netflix’s Fear Street.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxaiwlwm00243b8210cbvs8a@published data-word-count=120>Released over the course of a summer, the Fear Street trilogy is adapted from the books by R.L. Stine, and it explores the cursed origins of a town called Shadyside as a group of teen heroes try to survive it. Where Titane gave us radical art-house gender fuckery honored at Cannes, Fear Street is its popcorn-for-the-masses counterpart, piped into the homes of Netflix’s hundreds of millions of subscribers. Fear Street isn’t about coming out or fighting homophobia. It is just that timeless construct of two girls in love trying with their friends to stop a generations-long blight from destroying their home and their lives. It really feels like the gays have made it when Being Gay isn’t the point anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5c2/d04/b33dad1bc71c9f36f81b3aef8c43c30765-raw-secondary.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxaj4ew100293b827kfdzqpf@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Bodies Bodies Bodies" href=#>Bodies Bodies Bodies</a> (2022)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxaj5goa002f3b822w1d515a@published data-word-count=150>In this Gen-Z murder mystery, the first thing viewers see and hear is Amandla Stenberg making out with Maria Bakalova, but that somehow manages to be less gay than the movie’s ambient queerness. The feeling that you’re watching a bunch of bitchy 23-year-olds who either have or would hook up with each other given the chance suffuses the movie with a pansexual chaos that fuels the dark and stormy paranoia. Sure, girls kissing is cool, but screaming at your ex/ex–best friend at a sleepover while people are dying because you’re still more interested in who cheated on who and when? Now that’s gay culture. The old rules were “don’t ask, don’t tell.” The new rules say “tell all even if no one asks to make the party as messy as possible.” Do it for the drama! But ultimately, things really aren’t that deep here. Bodies Bodies is just so gay.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxai01xq001n3b82bkvlfhyz@published>Huesera: The Bone Woman (2023)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxapwsyf002l3b82c6m9hr1t@published data-word-count=151>Huesera is a great horror movie about a woman overcome by the emotional and body horror of impending motherhood, and it is positively chock-full of gays. The protagonist, Valeria, learns she is pregnant and then starts having hideous visions of broken, faceless women lurching toward her that no one else can see. She’s happily married to a sweet, stable professional, but as she plummets into paranoia and despair she is drawn back towards her punk rock ex-girlfriend. As the situation worsens and she appears crazy to everyone around her, Valeria’s only solace becomes a collective of witches — including her queer aunt — capable of purging the malevolence from her soul. That’s cool because gay witches are cool, but Huesera is also here to throw a grenade at the trappings of heteronormative domesticity when it mutes the authentic natures and desires of those who dare to live apart from such norms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/72f/ff3/d759fc417c8a18c0c803c4a84bfb3845f0-bodies-bodies-bodies.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxapx1he002q3b82oyel7w5e@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="I Saw The TV Glow " href=#>I Saw The TV Glow </a>(2024)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxapyphm002v3b82me642xtx@published data-word-count=144>Jane Schoenbrun had one of the most audacious contemporary debuts in genre cinema with her liminal, haunting mind-melter We’re All Going to the World’s Fair. It’s about a young girl living life mostly through screens in her attic bedroom, and who participates in a meme challenge that involves making a blood pact with the screen and then watching your body transform, a process she pledges to document online. Schoenbrun is a trans woman, and she started writing her follow-up, TV Glow, the summer she changed her name and began taking hormones. “I was attempting to make sense of the vast and sudden chasm that had opened underneath my feet in the aftermath of my egg crack,” she wrote of her catalyst for the film. “The freefall of utter precarity. Of one life that never felt real ending, and a new one struggling to begin.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxapz06l00303b824mfs9tnx@published data-word-count=116>And thus she created a sophomore film that Them described as “a simulation of gender dysphoria,” and follows two kids who are increasingly unsure which life is more real: the hazy corporeal one they are meandering through, or the one contained within the fantasy TV show that bonded them. <a href=#>As the story unfolds</a>, both characters also must decide what lengths they are willing to go to in order to realize an existence that feels more true — or what they are willing to endure throughout a life of pretending forever. <a href=#>Schoenbrun is an excellent filmmaker</a> who happens to be trans, but her lived experience is inextricable from the resonance and narrative layering of her mesmerizing stories.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clxaqc8cl00343b82swn5fmpw@published>Slay (2024)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxasm31i00393b82ggntigva@published data-word-count=129>The way the streaming boom has completely exploded the economics of film and television is a complex industry shift to unpack. But putting the bulk of that matter aside, digital distribution and streamer originals have created a lane for a certain kind of movie to get made that deserves to exist, but would have probably stood little chance at getting financed with traditional barriers standing in the way of money and wide distribution. Slay is one such movie. While this drag queen From Dusk Till Dawn has that traditional made-for-TV feel written all over it, as an R-rated Tubi original it can have all the gore of a good vampire movie along with all the profanity and double entendre of a drag show without being neutered for the sponsors.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxasmf8i003e3b82cjiab1jg@published data-word-count=124>Slay shows exactly what gets lost in a drag-showcase movie like The Bitch Who Stole Christmas, which was made for VH1, by letting its stars perform a lip sync to the uncensored version of “WAP.” Drag-queen story hour at your local library may be a beautifully inclusive kind of queer ambassador event for kids to experience drag, but that art form is also bawdy and confrontational and often NSFW. Just like horror. And the two coming together for a campy, bloody, funny, and tender genre movie shows off the fun of two art forms that are currently operating at their peak and reaching a more vast audience than ever before. The creatures of the night should band together, and they should be fully uncensored.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>61 Essential Queer Horror Films</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnx2gYyeqqydnqm2oriMqqyenaJitbC%2B0aipZp6Zobq0esetpKU%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alana-holland-bio-wiki-age-birthday-height-family-education-tv5-leaving-wnem-wzzm-husband-wedding-married-salary-and-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alana Holland Bio, Wiki, Age, Birthday, Height, Family, Education, TV5, Leaving WNEM, WZZM, Husband,</a>
