But thanks to the input of the series’ Native crew and the community members of its primary filming location, real-life Okmulgee, the <a href=#>Reservation Dogs</a> hometown crackles with energy and life. It’s cliché to say a TV series setting is a character, but with its precise and unexpected details —&nbsp;as minute as the type of flowers used for a funeral service and as sobering as the reflection of moonlight on a dorm-room floor as two nuns drag a screaming child across it&nbsp;— Okern was. Every aspect of Reservation Dogs’ look was crafted with intention, and it showed onscreen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3a34um001x3b7jufomoavi@published data-word-count=103>“When we’re creating and decorating the sets, we’re thinking about the people who will be watching at home, sure. But we’re equally, if not more, thinking about the people who will be in the room when it actually happens,” says production designer Brandon Tonner-Connolly, who joined the series after its pilot and worked on all three seasons. “We’re thinking about the crew and cast who are from the community, and the people down the block who might stop by to watch filming. We want them to feel the spaces are right. It’s about that experience as much as the final product on film.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3a39lp00233b7j99hz1qfs@published data-word-count=133>Time and time again, the series asked its art team — led in season three by Tonner-Connolly and set decorator Tafv Sampson — to invite viewers into the rooms where Okern’s residents spend their time. Those locations roughly divide into two categories: The reservation’s homes and communal spaces are “washed with warmth and comfort and cozy,” reflecting the Native aesthetic Sampson grew up with in Okmulgee (her father is the late actor Tim Sampson). “There’s never any coldness or harsh lines; everything’s warm wood and soft goods and little lighting and handwritten notes and junk mail,” she explains. “Little things everywhere, that’s how my dad was.” Then, as the series progressed, it went darker, spending significant time illuminating the space that tried to stamp out and exploit Native identity: the Indian boarding school.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3a34x3001y3b7jdfk2d07d@published data-word-count=104>Depicting the range of Native experience was essential to Reservation Dogs co-creator, director, and writer Sterlin Harjo, as was filming nearly every scene on location in Oklahoma. Tonner-Connolly and Sampson spoke to Vulture about collaborating on the show’s definitive and most involved sets and how their teams worked to align these spaces with “the universe of Reservation Dogs,” as Tonner-Connolly puts it. “You’re giving people the opportunity to experience life in a different place,” he explains. “The character details we put into a set create intimacy, and intimacy builds empathy, and conveying that experience helps someone understand and feel another kind of person’s world.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln3a3gxe00283b7jjk80gqxq@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Okern Indian Health Clinic</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/08f/e63/1c2597d0d0209d518952fb7763f4d9301d-IHS-Outside-Mural-2-of-2.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ce6/28e/b449d30f7d7ed9e0cee2d149e937c3acdd-IHS-Inside-Mural.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <strong class=caption-prefix></strong> <span class=full><strong class=caption-prefix></strong></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2cc/eee/c814f186dfb7f51f9391e7e65e9fd935fa-IHS-Spirit-Anatomy-Poster.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cbb/04e/fd5d598f2aa0c74ba5b2d42d5178fbf4e6-Eagles-Corner-Outside.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <strong class=caption-prefix></strong> <span class=full><strong class=caption-prefix></strong></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3a7v06002s3b7jdrl3yx6u@published data-word-count=104>Introduced in the series’ second episode, “<a href=#>NDN Clinic</a>,” the medical center that employs and treats many of the Rez Dogs’ relatives and mentors became a recurring location as well as the starting point for the formation of many unlikely bonds.

TJ Redcorn was our PA and we have an original painting by his family member. We have my auntie’s “Hunk Wall” — she was obsessed with Bon Jovi and Marlon Brando, and had taped magazine cutouts of her hunks on this board. I put my dad’s second-grade picture in the lampshade, so you can see it when Fixico’s singing and lighting sage. We had some necklaces, we had some actual clothing; there’s a jacket hanging on the wall that belonged to a crew member’s relative who had passed away. We had a traditional Creek love doll from a crew member hanging next to Mabel’s bed. They’re very sweet and beaded and felted, and we put it right next to her headboard so it was almost watching over her. Some things were really sacred objects and some were just silly, but they carried a lot of weight. About ten to 15 people gave us things —&nbsp;the number of things in the room was in the 40s.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3alzh9007j3b7j9srxo1r9@published data-word-count=46>We all took turns coming into that room and crying.

We did bring in an iron, heat it up, and actually burn the carpet to tell the story of, maybe Mabel was ironing and a tiny Elora Danan knocked the iron over.

Prison tables are not something you can fake by going to Bed Bath & Beyond. We needed to steal them from another part of the jail. Our set-decoration team spent days grinding out these prison tables that were bolted into cement, then hauling them over to our actual set and securing them there. It was hilarious because you’d be scavenging for something you wanted, you’d see it in another room and try to get in, then realize it was securely locked because it’s a prison. And nobody had the key. [Laughs.] The set-decoration and the art department worked miracles transforming the space. It was totally worth it for the amazing scenes with Lily and Paulina and Tafv in there. The photo of Daniel was provided by actor Dalton Cramer.

We had a swirling star chart painted on the wall next to where Bear would wake up. I don’t think you saw it in the episode, but we had the night sky painted on the ceiling of the trailer so Maximus could sit on his couch and look up and see his idea of the stars above him. In the greenhouse, we have a medicine-wheel-like symbol with a star chart painted on the wall. The tunnel has similar symbols in it for Bear to find glimpses of. We brought in vintage wallpaper and wood paneling to create some visual chaos with all the different newspaper textures inside the trailer.

Peppered with flashbacks to one of the notorious boarding schools that abducted Native children from their families and violently forced assimilation upon them, the season-three episode is both a horror movie and an origin story for Okern’s mythical vigilante. Its period-piece accuracy was accomplished through what Tonner-Connolly describes as “copious, copious” research into the destructive impact of boarding schools. What no one could prepare for, though, was the electrical fire that burned down the warehouse holding production’s materials for the episode.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3aun5s00ct3b7jnliotbf9@published data-word-count=92><strong>B T-C: </strong>Before we started the season officially, we were trying to find any photo of a boarding school from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, especially on the Plains. Tafv went to Anadarko, Oklahoma, to meet with people at the historical archives and gather images, and we had a consultant come onboard, Denise K. Lajimodiere, who is the author of Stringing Rosaries: The History, the Unforgivable, and the Healing of Northern Plains American Indian Boarding School Survivors. She answered our many questions about plates, spoons, bedding, desks, everything.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3gguou001d3b7lms2wuslc@published data-word-count=109>Once we had all the research, we found Bacone College. It allowed us to shoot almost everything from that episode on this one campus. <a href=#>Danis Goulet</a>, the director, came in with amazing visual ideas, including giving the episode a very ’70s-horror aesthetic with long lenses and this palpable sense of dread. We talked about <a href=#>Luca Guadagnino’s Suspiria</a> and a few other films as color-palette references. The genre aesthetic was a nice way of making the incredibly weighty subject matter a little more digestible, so it felt fantastical or like a dream rather than a gritty doc. It also set this particular episode aside in its own very separate universe.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3av21j00d13b7jo9lu7q0l@published data-word-count=152>We started in this giant hall that was being used as a storage room. It had mounted flatscreen TVs, low-pile carpet, reminders that we were in the year 2023. I looked at the references and picked out some period elements that were important, like a hardwood floor with very high gloss so it kicked back moonlight during the night scenes and added this mythical feeling. We incorporated small decorative crosses on the wood paneling so you always feel hemmed in by the religious element of the surroundings. Our art director, Matt Hyland, and our construction coordinator, Aaron Maier, were able to build and install this flooring, this paneling, and a million other details in this very large space. The whole thing has a really heavy, emotional weight of this terrible history.

It was like, yes, this is terrible; yes, we’re all logistically and emotionally affected by this. But at the same time, we’ve got to do this thing. If we don’t do it, nobody’s gonna do it.

We created our own sign, painted it red and white, added the period Sonic menus —&nbsp;they gave us permission so we could do that.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cln3aybrh00fy3b7jfsqz0kol@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Fixico’s resting place</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bf2/7f1/e847dbbd076cd72b9c6dae397b2e6c6da1-Cemetery-Inside-Wallflowers---Version-2.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class=caption-prefix></strong> <span class=full><strong class=caption-prefix></strong></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3az1an00gf3b7jyzw8nbgw@published data-word-count=93>In series finale “<a href=#>Dig</a>,” the entire Okern community gathers — as they did in “Mabel” — to say good-bye to medicine man Fixico at a church and cemetery that haven’t appeared in the series before. Nearly every Native character previously seen on the show pops up in the episode, either hanging out outside with the elders, cooking in the kitchen with the aunties, or digging the grave with the uncles overnight. As one of the last scenes filmed for the series, the ceremony was a meaningful end for the crew’s years of work.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3az9zk00gn3b7j7iow4o3v@published data-word-count=90><strong>TS: </strong>That’s a real Native church an hour from Tulsa. Wotko Long is everywhere in this show — he’s playing the security guard, he’s singing next to Mabel. When we went to scout the cemetery, there’s a guy on a lawnmower mowing between the graves. I was like, “Is that Wotko?” It was! He tends to the grounds of that church. In real life, he’s so part of the community. And we’re all going around looking at the names and saying, “I think we might be related to that person.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3az9zl00go3b7jdkuoq7up@published data-word-count=73><strong>B T-C: </strong>We wanted to be respectful of everything and everyone here. We ended up getting a space approved by the cemetery for digging the grave and we came up with a chart of how it would look for each scene. We dug a full grave in one spot and then a couple feet away dug half a grave, and then we were able to shoot back-and-forth according to what the scene indicated.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3az9zl00gp3b7jhkiicd8c@published data-word-count=112>When we were digging the actual grave, the backhoe wasn’t totally cutting it. We had our people actually digging a grave by hand. They got down to four feet and they were like, “It’s bedrock after this, is this good enough?” I was like “No, it’s not, unfortunately.” [Laughs.] It’s got to be as deep as the actual grave would be. This is such an emotional moment. We’re going to have people standing in the grave. We don’t want 100 people out here filming this scene and then somebody’s like, “Well, it might be a little shallow.” We ended up having to jackhammer through bedrock to get it down to six feet.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3az9zm00gq3b7j6kti3wj4@published data-word-count=64><strong>TS: </strong>We added some curtains to the interior of the church. Fixico is such a vibrant part of this show, and we really wanted his arrangements and feeling of his casket to be as abundant and as warm as the summer they’re in. We decided on wildflowers, because that’s what he is. Richard Ray Whitman gave us his own blanket, which is really special.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3az9zm00gr3b7jom2qq275@published data-word-count=105><strong>B T-C: </strong>We built all 30 benches for that outdoor space. We left them with the church so they could use them after that. It was a really special experience being in that space at night, shooting the last couple scenes of the entire show and having everybody together. After we wrapped, we all went over to a space next to the church outside of the cemetery and Sterlin got up and gave a speech about the show and his feelings and thanking everybody. Everybody hugged and had a nice sort of reminiscence over the past couple of years. There was not a dry eye.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cln3j9mzw000j3b7jvlimnkaj@published data-word-count=9>These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><h2>More ‘Reservation Dogs’</h2><ul class=package-list-items><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clqfp0ups001y0ig2yog1auda@published data-track-headline="The 10 Best TV Needle Drops of 2023" data-track-index=0 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>The 10 Best TV Needle Drops of 2023</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clqflm1zf00000iitov8yi5q5@published data-track-headline="The Weepiest TV Moments of 2023" data-track-index=1 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>The Weepiest TV Moments of 2023</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clfvfo19900160if7cvsepdh4@published data-track-headline="The Best TV Shows of 2023" data-track-index=2 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>The Best TV Shows of 2023</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clnbz4bg7002b0iejz0vb02k2@published data-track-headline="Soundtracking a Coming of Age" data-track-index=3 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Soundtracking a Coming of Age</span></a></li></ul><a class=see-all-link href=# aria-label="See All from More ‘Reservation Dogs’"><span class=see-all-link-text>See All</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Assembling Okern</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnypu9ZmqZ6rlafDosDIqKVmnJ%2BcwG6u1KKjrWWfoLKzuoyipWanm6LCrbPEnmSoo5yWtbC5wGefraWc</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chubby-checker-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-443451-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chubby Checker Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
