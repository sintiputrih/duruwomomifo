He wanted to cast his brother-in-law and actor, Srimurali, in it; however, he changed his original idea and wrote an action film, Ugramm, for him instead. The film was released under his own production company, Inkfinite Pictures, and succeeded in becoming one of the highest-grossing Kannada films of 2014. In an interview, Prashanth said that he had no expectations from his debut movie. He said,</p><p>We never thought it would go past the morning show. Nobody even knew me then. So with my first film, the journey was very important, but the destination not so much”</p><p>Later, Prashanth met producer Vijay Kiragandur to narrate a story, but Vijay asked him if he had any other raw project. Upon being asked, Prashanth narrated to him the script of K.G.F: Chapter 1, and everything fell in place for him. The movie was released in 2018 and collected Rs. 250 crore at the Box Office. It became a blockbuster in Hindi as well, when Baahubali distributor, Anil Thadani, decided to give it a wide release in Hindi. In an interview, Prashanth said that he wrote the script only as a writer and not as a director. He said,</p><p>When you think like a director, you become practical and start thinking of budget constraints. Right there, one stops dreaming big,”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Prashanth-celeberating-with-the-cast-and-crew-of-KGF.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-98248 class=wp-caption-text>Prashanth celebrates with the cast and crew of KGF</p><p>His third directorial, ‘KGF: Chapter 2’, was scheduled for a theatrical release on 16 July 2021 but was delayed due to the second wave of the COVID – 19 pandemic in India. The movie is expected to be released in 5 different languages on 14 April 2022. With the release of his much-hyped movie ‘KGF: Chapter 2’, Prashanth has spoken about his upcoming projects, which include Salaar, NTR30, and Bagheera (writer). According to Prashanth, his first duty on the set was to motivate every actor. In an interview, he said,</p><p>I don’t yell at them or get mad at them. Actors’ moods are very important to me.

That was the culture I grew up in.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>According to Prashanth, his family had orthodox thinking and would restrict him, had they known he was up to filmmaking. In an interview, he said,<br><p>Unless you are born in a filmy family, there’s a bias against cinema as a profession. And coming from an orthodox family, my mother wasn’t keen that I take it up. So I did not even tell my family about my plan, lest they discourage me.

That’s my style! But Salaar is a fresh story. It’s not a remake or adaptation of Ugramm.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>Upon noticing the trend in his movies, he was asked in an interview about the thing that draws him to violence in movies. He replied,<br><p>We don’t have a culture of using the World War or such subjects as premises for our films. So, my logic is that the stronger the villain is, the stronger the heroism that can be shown onscreen. I try to create an environment where it offers both of these. In our given scenario, I will not be able to achieve villainy to that level, nor will I be able to elevate heroism to that point. This is why I try to make my world more violent.”</p></li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Ridhima Ghosh Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Ridhima Ghosh Wiki, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Aamir Liaquat Hussain Wiki, Age, Death, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Aamir Liaquat Hussain Wiki, Age, Death, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Jaspreet Singh Wiki, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Jaspreet Singh Wiki, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Gajendra Chauhan Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Gajendra Chauhan Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography & More</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunC80ZqqoZmeqbVuusSeo2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ravi-cabot-conyers-height-age-who-family-biography-wiki-net-worth-19171-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ravi Cabot-Conyers Height, Age, Who, Family, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</a>
