In addition, the iconic meal has a fascinating backstory. And to understand why Americans eat 150 million hot dogs every independence day, let’s check this background story.</p><p>Nathan Handwerker’s story started out like so many other American dream stories. He dreamed of a better life while working at a restaurant run by Charles Feltman of Coney Island, who is often recognized as the inventor of the hot dog. Handwerker slept on the restaurant’s kitchen floor and ate complimentary hot dogs to save money.</p><p>He left Feltman after a year and started his own hot dog shop on Surf and Stillwell Avenues in Coney Island, just a few blocks from his previous employer’s hot dog stand.</p><p>Handwerker sold his dogs for five cents, half the price of Feltman’s, thanks to his wife Ida’s secret spice mix. However, the business continued to struggle. As a result, he did what any smart businessman would do: he staged a publicity stunt.</p><p>Handwerker was working at his hot dog stand on July 4, 1916, when he overheard a conversation nearby. “The tale I’ve always heard is that on July 4th, four immigrants were disputing about who was the most American,” says Richard Shea, President of Major League Eating. Handwerker decided to put the four men to the test.</p><p>Shea explains, “Nathan replied, ‘I’ll tell you what, whoever can eat the most of my hot dogs is the most American.” Handwerker’s offer was accepted by the men. James Mullen, an Irish immigrant, won the event by devouring 13 hot dogs in 12 minutes, demonstrating his patriotism. It was then that Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest was conceived.</p><p>While Shea acknowledges that the tournament serves as an excellent advertisement for Nathan’s Famous, he argues that everything that happens on stage is genuine. “It’s real.”</p><p>The fact that we don’t tinker with the results or force the narrative is one of the reasons I believe this competition appeals to people. The diners are mostly regular girls and guys… the majority of these guys have day jobs.”</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Top 10 Places To Celebrate American Independence Day (July 4th)</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Why-Americans-Eat-150-Million-Hot-Dogs-Every-Independence-Day-.jpg alt="Why Americans Eat 150 Million Hot Dogs Every Independence Day" width=1580 height=821 sizes="(max-width: 1580px) 100vw, 1580px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3>How Hot Dog Became Synonymous With American’s Food Culture.</h3><p>Nathan’s had to persuade America that hot dog is particularly American food in order to successfully connect hot dogs and the Fourth of July. In that sense, they are correct.</p><p>In his book “Hot Dog: A Global History,” food historian and President-Emeritus of the Culinary Historians of Chicago Bruce Kraig states, “A hot dog belongs to the old family of enclosed meals.” He stated that it’s a member of the sausage family, which can be traced back to the 1400s in Germany.</p><h3>Will Americans Consume 150 Million Hot Dogs This Year (2022)</h3><p>According to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council, Americans will consume more than 150 million hot dogs this Fourth of July. Despite the fact that hot dogs are a typical American dish, a sizable section of the population wonders if they are unhealthy.</p><p>Without sodium nitrate, hot dogs, which are commonly produced from pork, beef, and chicken trimmings combined with food starch, “flavourings,” and corn syrup, would be grey.</p><p>Sodium nitrate is added to the meat slurry during the hot dog-making process to make it look more attractive. While excessive dosages of sodium nitrate can be carcinogenic, the levels seen in commercial hot dogs are considered “safe.” Traditional hot dogs, on the other hand, are not a suitable choice.</p><p>As hot dog stalls and carts grew in popularity across the United States, so did the jokes surrounding the name. As did the various sorts of hot dogs prevalent in various civilizations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOsJ%2ByZZGisrO1wpqlrGWVlsFufZRpZKahnKG2sLqMoaatZZSktLR5xK%2Bcq7Fdnrulsc%2BepZ2dnpiybrDAsmY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./benicio-del-toro-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Benicio del Toro Net Worth</a>
