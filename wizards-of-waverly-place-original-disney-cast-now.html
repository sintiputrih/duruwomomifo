We've got the lowdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775183.jpg><h3>Selena Gomez - Alex Russo</h3><p>Selena, who played the Russo's only female sibling Alex, is easily the biggest name to come out of the Wizards of Waverly Place.</p><p>Her character was focal in the series, ultimately beating her two younger brothers to retain her magical powers in the Disney finale.</p><p>Following her TV career, Selena went on to release chart hits one after another, following in the footsteps of other Disney Channel stars like Hilary Duff, Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato.</p><p>With MTV, Billboard and American Music awards until her belt, she's released songs like Bad Liar and Lose You To Love Me.</p><p>Other catchy songs include The Dead Don't Die and Spring Breakers - as well as releasing Spanish pop album Revelación.</p><p>She's starred in films as a voice actress, including the daughter of Dracula in Hotel Transylvania, which is due to release its fourth film this summer.</p><p>Gomez has also been busy doing some impressive charity work, becoming an appointed UNICEF ambassador when she was just seventeen years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hayley-kiyoko-attends-stella-mccartney-806141960.jpg><h3>Hayley Kiyoko - Stevie</h3><p>Stevie was introduced as Alex's friend, played by actress Hayley Kiyokoask, in the third season.</p><p>In a recent interview executive producer Peter Murrieta shared that he had always imagined Gomez's character Alex Russo having a gay relationship with Stevie.</p><p>While speaking on the Wizards Of Waverly Pod show with co-hosts Jennifer Stone and David DeLuise, he said: "I wished we could have played more with what was quite obvious to a lot of us.</p><p>"We weren't able to in that time, but it was pretty clear to all of us what that relationship was."</p><p>Following the show actress Hayley came out as gay.</p><p>She is now a pop star and is currently on tour around Europe, with 1.9million fans on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000601081719.jpg><h3>David Henrie - Justin Russo</h3><p>David played the oldest of the three Russo children, Justin - an extremely intelligent and fiercely competitive wannabe wizard.</p><p>Even though Alex triumphed him in the wizarding competition, he got to keep his too after he was rewarded by the WizTech headmaster.</p><p>Henrie already had an impressive resume before he even joined Wizards of Waverly Place, with recurring acting roles throughout his childhood.</p><p>He was a part of Method & Red and That's So Raven, another hit tweenage TV show, before he got further recognition from Disney.</p><p>In 2016, the star took a break from his career to get married to former Miss Delaware 2011 Maria Cahill in an intimate ceremony.</p><p>Since then, he's kept a lower profile, getting in trouble with the law in 2018 after being arrested in LAX airport carrying a loaded gun.</p><p>Nonetheless, David has still starred in a number of high-profile films including Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 and Warrior Road.</p><p>In 2020, he directed a film for the first time - This is the Year - a high school comedy about friends on a road trip to a music festival.</p><p>He regularly takes part in meet and greets with fans of Wizards of Waverly Place for charity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-13.03.42.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775184.jpg><h3>Jake T Austin - Max Russo</h3><p>Jake played the youngest of three in the Russo brood - Max - who was frequently overshadowed by his more talented siblings.</p><p>Max was the only one of the three siblings to miss out on keeping his wizard powers in the final contest, but ran the family store instead.</p><p>He seemed happy enough to take his consolation prize, but in real life, Austin has found more success in live action and voice actor.</p><p>Austin landed the role of Jesus Foster on The Fosters, as well as the voice of Diego in Dora the Explorer and the spin-off Go, Diego, Go.</p><p>He has also voiced actors in box-office hits Rio 2 and The Emoji Movie, as well as Angel Reyes (aka Blue Beetle) in animated DC projects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775187.jpg><h3>Jennifer Stone - Harper Finkle</h3><p>Jennifer was not one of the Russo's - but appeared in every single episode of Wizards of Waverly Place as Alex's best friend.</p><p>Harper didn't have any magical abilities and was oblivious to the Russo's for quite some time, but soon became a de facto member of the clan.</p><p>Since the Disney show, she hasn't built up a large list of credits as she battled Latent Autoimmune Diabetes - a type of Type 1 Diabetes.</p><p>Following her diagnosis in 2013, she stepped back from acting to get a degree in nursing to help others who suffer from her disease.</p><p>While she is now a registered nurse, she did return to the TV world in 2019 to co-write and star in The In-Between, a film about two women with medical issues.</p><p>She now hosts a podcast about Wizards of Waverly Place with former co-star David DeLuise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775185.jpg><h3>Maria Canals-Barrera - Theresa Russo</h3><p>The Russo family matriarch was Theresa, played by Maria Canals-Barrera - and she was the only non-magical member of the family.</p><p>Since her Wizards days, she has had a fairly long run of voice acting, mainly for comic book properties, and television series.</p><p>Maria has voiced characters like Hawkgirl and She-Hulk in video games, as well as Rio Morales in Ultimate Spider Man, Dr Vargas in Vixen: The Movie and Ellen Yindel in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.</p><p>Her live action roles include ABC series Cristela, where she played Daniela.</p><p>She regularly attends Comic Cons representing the Wizards of Waverly Place cast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775191.jpg><h3>David DeLuise - Jerry Russo</h3><p>David DeLuise played the family patriarch - but was already a member of acting royalty before starring in Wizards of Waverly Place.</p><p>He is the son of Dom DeLuise, a comedy star who appeared in classic films Blazing Saddles, Silent Movie, The Muppet Movie and Cannonball Run.</p><p>His mum was actress Carol Arthur, who starred in The Sunshine Boys as well as numerous Mel Brooks movies.</p><p>David's brothers Peter DeLuise and Michael DeLuise have also starred in a number of films including 21 Jump Street, Gilmore Girls and Encino Man.</p><p>Since Wizards, David has continued to have success in the acting world including in series NCIS, Shameless and Grey's Anatomy.</p><p>He has also been in a number of films including Pup Star, Sox, Abner the Invisible Dog and Beethoven's Treasure Trail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775190.jpg><h3>Bill Chott - Mr. Laritate</h3><p>Funnyman Bill Chott had been in a number of films before being cast as the hilarious school principal Mr Laritate in Wizards of Waverly Place.</p><p>Often having to deal with whatever hijinks the Russo's were stirring up, he was constantly trying to stand in their way and spoil the fun.</p><p>But in real life, the star has been in a number of comedic (and fun) films, including The Ringer, Dude Where's My Car, Galaxy Quest and Dana Carvey Show.</p><p>He has also appeared in a number of TV series, including ER and CSI, Monk and This Is Us - as well as comedy series Legion.</p><p>Chott has also voiced a number of animated characters in Christmas film Klaus, Young Sheldon and Curious George.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775304.jpg><h3>Gregg Sulkin - Mason Greyback</h3><p>Any tweenage series needs a romantic entanglement - and that's where Gregg Sulkin's character Mason Greyback comes in.</p><p>Mason was a werewolf that made sparse appearances on the show, but he was very important to the Russo's only daughter Alex.</p><p>Since his Disney stardom, Gregg had a short stint on Pretty Little Liars, as well as MTV series Faking It and MCU series Runaways.</p><p>Originally living in Britain, Sulkin got his American citizenship in 2018 - and he now lives across the pond where he continues to work.</p><p>He was the lead character in animated film The Adventures of Bunny Bravo and is currently filming Netflix's new series Pretty Smart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775275.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><h3>Daniel Benson - Zeke Beakerman</h3><p>Daniel Benson played Justin's best friend Zeke, who often found himself involved in the crazy lives of the Russo's.</p><p>Of all the cast members, Zeke has remained the most under-the-radar since the Disney show, only having a few credited film roles.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>As well as starring in The Rig and The Onion Movie, Daniel is a voice actor in Rick and Morty, with super-fans recognising him as Ethan.</p><p>He has turned to making a living through modelling on adult only site OnlyFans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668775305.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Selena Gomez reunites with Wizards of Waverly Place co-star David Henrie to film new project</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSAdIKPcmltZ6eex6K%2Bw6xkqJ5drK63sdGlsGaonJawpnnOq6CgoZ6WuW6wyKylnrFdmK60wIynprBn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./marshmello.html>&#171;&nbsp; Marshmello Alone lyrics</a>
